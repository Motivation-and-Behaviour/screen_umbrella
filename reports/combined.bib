  ABSTRACT = {ABSTRACT             Although several studies have investigated the association between Internet use and odds of overweight and obesity, results are inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to summarize evidence on the association between Internet use and odds of overweight and obesity. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to February 2019 to identify relevant publications. Finally, 9 cross-sectional studies were considered in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Combining 11 effect sizes from 9 studies, we found a significant, positive association between the highest Internet use, compared to the lowest (ranged from {$\geq$}5~h/d to no use among studies), and odds of overweight and obesity (OR: 1.47; 95\% CI: 1.21\textendash 1.78; I2, 69.6\%; P~{$<~$}0.001), such that Internet users had 47\% greater odds of being overweight or obese. We also observed a significant, positive association between the highest Internet use, compared to the lowest (ranged from {$\geq$}5~h/d to no use among studies), and overweight/obesity (OR: 1.15; 95\% CI: 1.06\textendash 1.25; I2, 0.0\%; P~=~0.426), obesity (OR: 2.58; 95\% CI: 1.88\textendash 3.54; I2, 0.0\%; P~=~0.637), and overweight (OR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.16\textendash 1.64; I2, 13.1\%; P~=~0.330). A linear dose-response meta-analysis revealed that each additional 1~h/d of Internet use was associated with 8\% increased odds of overweight and obesity (OR: 1.08; 95\% CI: 1.05\textendash 1.11; I2, 3.8\%; P~=~0.403). Findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that Internet use was positively associated with increased odds of being overweight and obese.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background               Despite the relevance of mobile technologies and social media (MTSM) for adolescents, their association with depressive disorders in this population remains unclear. While there are previous reviews that have identified the use of MTSM as a risk factor for developing depression, other reviews have indicated their possible preventive effect.                                         Objective               The aim of this review was to synthesize the current evidence on the association between MTSM use and the development or prevention of depressive disorders in adolescents.                                         Methods               An umbrella review was conducted using information published up to June 2019 from PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library. Systematic reviews focusing on the adolescent population (up to 20 years old) and depression and its potential relationship with MTSM use were included. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts was performed. After selecting the reviews and given the heterogeneity of the outcome variables and exposures, a narrative synthesis of the results was carried out.                                         Results               The search retrieved 338 documents, from which 7 systematic reviews (3 meta-analyses) were selected for data extraction. There were 11-70 studies and 5582-46,015 participants included in the 7 reviews. All reviews included quantitative research, and 2 reviews also included qualitative studies. A statistically significant association between social media and developing depressive symptoms was reported in 2 reviews, while 5 reviews reported mixed results.                                         Conclusions               Excessive social comparison and personal involvement when using MTSM could be associated with the development of depressive symptomatology. Nevertheless, MTSM might promote social support and even become a point of assistance for people with depression. Due to the mixed results, prospective research could be valuable for providing stronger evidence.}

  ABSTRACT = {Game-based learning has proven to be effective and is widely used in science education, but usually the heterogeneity of the student population is being overlooked. To examine the differential effects of game interventions in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related subjects on diverse student groups, a meta-analysis has been conducted that included 39 studies that compared game-based learning interventions with traditional classrooms in primary and early secondary education. We found moderate positive effects on cognition (g = .67), motivation (g = .51), and behaviour (g = .93). Additionally, substantial heterogeneity between studies was found. Moderator analyses indicated that primary school students achieve higher learning outcomes and experience game interventions as more motivating than secondary school students, whereas gender did not have any moderating effect. There were too few studies reporting information on the remaining moderators (socioeconomic status, migration background, and special educational needs) to include them in a multiple meta-regression model. Therefore, we assessed their role by separate moderator analyses, but these results need to be interpreted with caution. Additional descriptive analyses suggested that game-based learning may be less beneficial for students with low socioeconomic status compared to students with high socioeconomic status.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Sedentariness is a substantial risk for many chronic diseases. We aimed to investigate the correlation of sedentary behavior and its indicators with low back pain (LBP) among adults and children. Methods: Original articles published up to April 28, 2020, using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus were evaluated. Odds ratio (OR, 95\% CI) was considered the overall effect size for desired associations. Results: We reviewed 49 English articles with analytical observational study design, of which, 27 studies with cross sectional/survey design were retained in the meta-analysis. Among adults, sedentary lifestyle was a considerable risk factor for LBP (OR=1.24, 1.02-1.5); prolonged sitting time (OR=1.42, 1.09-1.85) and driving time (OR=2.03, 1.22-3.36) were the significant risk factors. Sedentary behavior was associated with LBP in office workers (OR=1.23). Moreover, excess weight (OR=1.35, 1.14-1.59) and smoking (OR=1.28, 1.03-1.60) were associated with LBP. Among children, sedentary lifestyle was a remarkable risk factor for LBP (OR=1.41, 1.24- 1.60); prolonged TV watching (OR=1.23, 1.08-1.41) and computer/mobile using and console playing time (OR=1.63, 1.36-1.95) were significant risk factors for LBP. Consumption of coffee, however, has yield conflicting results to be considered as a risk factor. Moreover, the researches on the correlation between sedentariness and high-intensity LBP are scarce and inconclusive. Conclusion: Sedentary behavior, whether in work or leisure time, associates with a moderate increase in the risk of LBP in adults, children and adolescents.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background:               A population level increase in physical activity (PA) is critical to reduce obesity in youth. Video games are highly popular and active video games (AVGs) have the potential to play a role in promoting youth PA.                                         Method:               Studies on AVG play energy expenditure (EE) and maintenance of play in youth were systematically identified in the published literature and assessed for quality and informational value.                                         Results:               Nine studies measuring AVG play EE were identified. The meta-analytic estimates of average METs across these studies were 3.1 (95\% CI: 2.6, 3.6) to 3.2 (95\% CI: 2.7, 3.7). No games elicited an average EE above the 6 MET threshold for vigorous EE. Observed differences between studies were likely due to the different types of games used, rather than age or gender. Four studies related to maintenance of play were identified. Most studies reported AV G use declined over time. Studies were of low-to-medium quality.                                         Conclusion:               AVGs are capable of generating EE in youth to attain PA guidelines. Few studies have assessed sustainability of AV G play, which appears to diminish after a short period of time for most players. Better-quality future research must address how AV G play could be maintained over longer periods of time.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background               Children and adolescents increasingly do not meet physical activity (PA) recommendations. Hence, insufficient PA (IPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) among children and adolescents are relevant behavior change domains for using individualized mobile health (mHealth) interventions.                                         Objective               This review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on IPA and SB, with a special focus on the age and level of individualization.                                         Methods               PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and March 2021. mHealth interventions for primary prevention in children and adolescents addressing behavior change related to IPA and SB were included. Included studies were compared for content characteristics and methodological quality and summarized narratively. In addition, a meta-analysis with a subsequent exploratory meta-regression examining the moderating effects of age and individualization on overall effectiveness was performed.                                         Results               On the basis of the inclusion criteria, 1.3\% (11/828) of the preliminary identified studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 1.2\% (10/828) were included in the meta-analysis. Trials included a total of 1515 participants (mean age (11.69, SD 0.788 years; 65\% male and 35\% female) self-reported (3/11, 27\%) or device-measured (8/11, 73\%) health data on the duration of SB and IPA for an average of 9.3 (SD 5.6) weeks. Studies with high levels of individualization significantly decreased insufficient PA levels (Cohen d=0.33; 95\% CI 0.08-0.58; Z=2.55; P=.01), whereas those with low levels of individualization (Cohen d=-0.06; 95\% CI -0.32 to 0.20; Z=0.48; P=.63) or targeting SB (Cohen d=-0.11; 95\% CI -0.01 to 0.23; Z=1.73; P=.08) indicated no overall significant effect. The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate to low, and significant subgroup differences were found between trials with high and low levels of individualization ({$\chi$}21=4.0; P=.04; I2=75.2\%). Age as a moderator variable showed a small effect; however, the results were not significant, which might have been because of being underpowered.                                         Conclusions               Evidence suggests that mHealth interventions for children and adolescents can foster moderate reductions in IPA but not SB. Moreover, individualized mHealth interventions to reduce IPA seem to be more effective for adolescents than for children. Although, to date, only a few mHealth studies have addressed inactive and sedentary young people, and their quality of evidence is moderate, these findings indicate the relevance of individualization on the one hand and the difficulties in reducing SB using mHealth interventions on the other.

  ABSTRACT = {Background Young people present high rates of cannabis use, abuse, and dependence. The United Nations estimates that roughly 3.8\% of the global population aged 15-64 years used cannabis at least once in 2017. Cannabis use in young people may impair cognitive skills, interfere with learning, impact relationships, and lead to long term behavioural and psychological consequences. Online cannabis interventions (OCI) are increasingly popular, but their dissemination is not often supported by empirical evidence. Aim To systematically compile and analyse the effectiveness of OCI for the reduction of cannabis use among adolescents and young adults (AYA). Methods Pooled effect sizes of cannabis use between treatment and control groups were estimated. For each comparison, Hedge's g was calculated using a random effects model. Results The search strategy yielded 4531 articles. Of those, a total of 411 articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation resulting in 17 eligible studies (n = 3525). Analyses revealed that online interventions did not significantly reduce cannabis consumption (Hedge's g = -0.061, 95\% CI [-0.363] to [-0.242], p = .695) and high heterogeneity was noted (Q = 191.290). More recent studies using structured interventions, daily feedback, AYA centred designs, and peer support, specifically targeting CU seemed to have positive effects to address CU in this population. Conclusions The lack of positive outcomes suggests that more specific and targeted interventions may be necessary to promote cannabis-related behavioural change among young people. These targeted interventions may include structured CU modules, daily feedback, peer support for increased adherence, user-centred design procedures, and input from key stakeholders such as families and service providers.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background               Physical activity (PA) is important for children with a chronic disease. Serious games may be useful to promote PA levels among these children.                                         Objective               The primary purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of serious games on PA levels in children with a chronic disease.                                         Methods               PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were systematically searched for articles published from January 1990 to May 2018. Both randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were included to examine the effects of serious games on PA levels in children with a chronic disease. Two investigators independently assessed the intervention, methods, and methodological quality in all articles using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed.                                         Results               This systematic review included 9 randomized controlled trials (886 participants). In 2 of the studies, significant between-group differences in PA levels in favor of the intervention group were reported. The meta-analysis on PA levels showed a nonsignificant effect on moderate to vigorous PA (measured in minutes per day) between the intervention and control groups (standardized mean difference 0.30, 95\% CI \textendash 0.15 to 0.75, P=.19). The analysis of body composition resulted in significantly greater reductions in BMI in the intervention group (standardized mean difference \textendash 0.24, 95\% CI \textendash 0.45 to 0.04, P=.02).                                         Conclusions               This review does not support the hypothesis that serious games improve PA levels in children with a chronic disease. The meta-analysis on body composition showed positive intervention effects with significantly greater reductions in BMI in favor of the intervention group. A high percentage of nonuse was identified in the study of serious games, and little attention was paid to behavior change theories and specific theoretical approaches to enhance PA in serious games. Small sample sizes, large variability between intervention designs, and limited details about the interventions were the main limitations. Future research should determine which strategies enhance the effectiveness of serious games, possibly by incorporating behavior change techniques.}

  DOI = {10.1111/jcal.12661},
  ABSTRACT = {Background: As a recently emerging innovative technology, augmented reality (AR) has become a popular tool for language learning. However, to date, very few meta-analytical studies has been conducted on AR in this field to understand its effectiveness on language learning. Objectives: This meta-analysis was conducted to systematically synthesize the findings from primary studies published between 2008 and 2020 to establish the effects of AR on language learning gains and students' motivation. Methods: The 21 studies met all the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis to extract effect size statistics. The robust variance estimation (RVE) technique using the "Robumeta" R-package was adopted to estimate the pooled effect size. Given the heterogeneity of the effect sizes, a mixed-effects meta-regression model was estimated to examine any association between the effectiveness of AR technologies and moderator variables. Results and conclusion: The pooled effect-size estimate was 0.93 for language gains and 0.42 for motivation, which indicates that AR applications have a large effect on learners' language gains and a small to medium effect on learners' motivation. The moderator analysis results suggested that learners' educational levels and intervention durations are significant moderating factors that impact the effect of AR on learners' motivation. In particular, elementary school students in this meta-analysis study experienced a large measurable effect in terms of both language gains and motivation. Additionally, exposure to AR applications for up to 1 week is especially effective for enhancing learners' motivation. Major takeaways: The findings of this meta-analysis study demonstrated how AR applications can be utilized in language teaching and learning contexts, and how language educators could adopt AR technologies in classrooms to promote learners' language gains and motivation. Lay Description: What is currently known?The advantages of augmented reality (AR) in education include learning gains and motivation improvementsAR applications can create an immersive environment for language learners and enrich the teaching and learning processesAR use should be connected to pedagogical theories and instructional strategies.What this paper adds?The specific effects of AR applications in language learning gains and students' motivationAn investigation into which moderator variables impact language learning when using AR applicationsImplications for practice:Language instructors might consider applying AR over a short period or as supplementary material to stimulate learning and motivation. However, when using AR applications for long-term teaching practices (for example, over a month), instructors should consider adopting additional pedagogical or learning strategies.Language instructors may consider adopting AR as an effective tool for vocabulary teaching, particularly for elementary school learners.In language classes, AR applications should not be restricted to a specific instructional strategy only but be used diversely.The adoption of AR techniques in the language classroom should not be limited to mobile devices. Language instructors, particularly those who have limited access to mobile devices, are also encouraged to apply alternative AR technologies, such as computer-based technologies, into their teaching.

  ABSTRACT = {Computer-based training has attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years. Several studies have found that computer-based training resulted in improved executive functions (EFs) in adults. However, it remains controversial whether children can benefit from computer-based training and what moderator could influence the training effects. The focus of the present meta-analysis was to examine the effects of computer-based training on EFs in children: working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. A thorough search of published work yielded a sample of 36 studies with 216 effect sizes. The results indicated that computer-based training showed moderate training effects on improving EFs in children ( g = 0.35, k = 36, p {$<$} 0.001), while training effects of working memory were significantly higher. Furthermore, we found near-transfer effects were marginally significantly higher than far-transfer effects. The standard training method was significantly more effective than training with game elements. In computer-based training, typically developing children had significantly better training effects than atypically developing children. Some additional factors, such as the number of training sessions and age, also modulated the training effects. In conclusion, the present study investigated the effects and moderators of computer-based training for children's EFs. The results provided evidence that computer-based training (especially standard training) may serve as an efficient way to improve EFs in children (especially typically developing individuals). We also discussed some directions for future computer-based training studies. (Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Cao, Huang, Huang, Xie and Wang.)}

  ABSTRACT = {Background               Mobile phone use has brought convenience, but the long or improper use of mobile phones can cause harm to the human body.                                         Objective               We aimed to assess the impact of improper mobile phone use on the risks of accidents and chronic disorders.                                         Methods               We systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to April 5, 2019; relevant reviews were also searched to identify additional studies. A random-effects model was used to calculate the overall pooled estimates.                                         Results               Mobile phone users had a higher risk of accidents (relative risk [RR] 1.37, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.55). Long-term use of mobile phones increased accident risk relative to nonuse or short-term use (RR 2.10, 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.70). Compared with nonuse, mobile phone use resulted in a higher risk for neoplasms (RR 1.07, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.14), eye diseases (RR 2.03, 95\% CI 1.27 to 3.23), mental health disorders (RR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.32), and headaches (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.32); the pooled risk of other chronic disorders was 1.20 (95\% CI 0.90 to 1.59). Subgroup analyses also confirmed the increased risk of accidents and chronic disorders.                                         Conclusions               Improper use of mobile phones can harm the human body. While enjoying the convenience brought by mobile phones, people have to use mobile phones properly and reasonably.}

  ABSTRACT = {Addictive behaviors have traditionally been associated with low self-esteem, and Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) has recently received increasing scientific attention as a potential behavioral addiction. The present meta analysis aims to examine the strength of the relationship between PSU symptoms and global self-esteem. A keyword-based systematic literature search was performed to identify studies in which PSU symptoms and global self-esteem were assessed. Thirty-one independent studies with a total of 27.004 participants (F \% = 54.21\%; mean age = 17.37 +/- 4.97; range: 12.10-34.39 years old) were included. Meta-analytic results of the random effects model applied to a total of 31 independent samples show a negative correlation between self-esteem and PSU (Fisher's Z = -0.25; CI -0.28, -0.21; Z = -14.63; p {$<$} 0.001). Age, gender and geographical area did not moderate the association. The magnitude of the effect size can be considered small according to Cohen's criteria (1992), and medium according to Hemphill's criteria (2003). The sensitivity analysis and analyses of publication bias confirm that these results are robust. The findings show that low self-esteem is an important hallmark of PSU. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of addressing self-esteem and corresponding core beliefs in the prevention and treatment of PSU.}

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the quasi-experimental studies on the effectiveness of DGS-based instruction in improving students' mathematical achievement. Research articles published between 1990 and 2013 were identified from major databases according to a prespecified search strategy and selection criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted based on the random-effects model to evaluate the effectiveness of DGS-based instruction in terms of standardized mean differences (SMD) of achievement test scores as outcome measures. Nine quasi-experimental DGS studies with 587 participants were eligible. The overall effect size of DGS-based instruction on achievement scores (i.e., SMD) was distinctive (SMD, 1.02; 95\% CI: 0.56\textendash 1.48) compared to traditional instruction. Subgroup analysis found some groups to have better effectiveness, for example, short-term instruction with DGS significantly improved the mathematical achievement of elementary school students.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: ESports has evolved into a hyper-competitive genre of video gaming. Emerging evidence has linked its intense engagement with mental health problems, with implications on youth development. We aim to summarise the impact of eSports and online video gaming on lifestyle outcomes. Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in journals published in the English language since 2011. We searched PubMed, Web of Science (WoS) and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) using search strings related to eSports or video-gaming and lifestyle behaviours. Results: We identified 3694 studies, 36 of which met the inclusion criteria. The studies reported associations between online video gaming (including eSports participation and consumption) and poor lifestyle outcomes: physical activity-related (decreased levels of physical activity, increased body mass index (BMI) and sedentary behaviour)nutrition-related (poorer diet, sweetened beverage consumption) and sleep-related outcomes (decreased quality/duration, increased sleepiness/sleep deprivation). One study investigated physical lifestylerelated outcomes (eye strain, wrist pain, neck pain) Results indicate a widening breadth of research investigating associations between lifestyle outcomes and online video gaming. Conclusion: Lifestyle outcomes associated with engagement in eSports and video gaming are important to consider. This emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies which examine characteristics of gaming that may increase young people's risk of practicing unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. The accessibility of eSports to a wide digital audience highlights the need for this sector to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours among consumers and gamers.}

  ABSTRACT = {Digital game-based learning (DGBL) is known to be widely used for improving learning in various fields. Among the elements of DGBL, competition has been very controversial. This meta-analysis, which included 25 articles written between 2008 and 2019, revealed that DGBL has produced improvements for learning outcomes with an overall effect size of 0.386. In addition, we explored multiple moderators to understand how competition in DGBL influenced student learning for different learners, contexts, game types, and learning outcomes. We found that competition in DGBL was effective for math, science and language, but not for social science and other subjects. It was effective for K12 students and college students. It was effective for puzzle, strategy, role-playing, and simulation, but not for action games. Finally, competition in DGBL was equally effective for cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. Through the results of this study, we fill a critical gap in the research left by recent reviews, which do not examine the role of competition; a key gaming element. In addition, we offer a number of suggestions for future studies.}

  ABSTRACT = {Cyberbullying has become a critical social issue, which severely threatens children and adolescents' physical and psychological health. The current research systematically examined the predictors of cyberbullying from the social cognitive and media effects approach. Specifically, this study identified 16 predictors of cyberbullying perpetration and victimization and examined the magnitude of the effects of these predictors by meta-analyzing 81 empirical studies, which represented a total sample of 99,741 participants and yielded 259 independent correlations. The results revealed that risky information and communications technology (ICT) use, moral disengagement, depression, social norms, and traditional bullying perpetration were the main predictors of cyberbullying perpetration, while risky ICT use and traditional bullying victimization were the major contributors of cyberbullying victimization. According to the moderator analyses, country of the sample, sampling method, age, and media platform were significant moderators of the relationships between some specific predictors and cyberbullying perpetration and victimization. Implications for future cyberbullying research were discussed.}

  ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study was to meta-analyze the effectivity of interventions for children with mathematical difficulties. Furthermore, we investigated whether the fit between characteristics of participants and interventions was a decisive factor. Thirty-five evaluation studies that used pre-post-control group designs with at least 10 participants per group were analyzed. Using a random-effects model, we found a high, significant mean effect ( [Formula: see text] = 0.83) for the standardized mean difference. Moreover, a significant effect was found for studies that used direct or assisted instruction, that fostered basic arithmetical competencies, and that used single-subject settings. Effect size was not moderated by administration mode (computer-based vs. face-to-face intervention) or by whether interventions were derived from theory. Interventions for children with at-risk dyscalculia were effective on average. Results of the fit between characteristics of the participants and intervention characteristics are provided. In summary, mathematics interventions are found to be effective for children with mathematical difficulties, though there was a high effect size variance between studies.}

  ABSTRACT = {The use of mobile technologies has recently received great attention in language learning. Most research evaluates the effects of employing mobile devices in language learning and explores the design of mobile-learning interventions that can maximize the benefits of new technologies. However, it is still unclear whether the use of mobile devices in language learning is more effective than other instructional approaches. It is also not clear whether the effects of mobile-device use vary in different settings. Our meta-analysis will explore these questions about mobile technology use in language learning. Based on the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 d-type effect sizes from 20 studies were calculated for the meta-analysis. We adopted the random-effects model, and the estimated average effect was 0.51 (se = 0.10). This is a moderate positive overall effect of using mobile devices on language acquisition and language-learning achievement. Moderator analyses under the mixed-effects model examined six features; effects varied significantly only by test type and source of the study. The overall effect and the effects of these moderators of mobile-device use on achievement in language learning are discussed.}

  ABSTRACT = {Parenting and family environment have significant impact on child development, including development of executive function, attention, and self-regulation, and may affect the risk of developmental disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This paper examines the relationship of parenting and family environment factors with ADHD. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in 2014 and identified 52 longitudinal studies. A follow-up search in 2021 identified 7 additional articles, for a total of 59 studies that examined the association of parenting factors with ADHD outcomes: ADHD overall (diagnosis or symptoms), ADHD diagnosis specifically, or presence of the specific ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For parenting factors that were present in three or more studies, pooled effect sizes were calculated separately for dichotomous or continuous ADHD outcomes, accounting for each study's conditional variance. Factors with sufficient information for analysis were parenting interaction quality (sensitivity/warmth, intrusiveness/reactivity, and negativity/harsh discipline), maltreatment (general maltreatment and physical abuse), parental relationship status (divorce, single parenting), parental incarceration, and child media exposure. All factors showed a significant direct association with ADHD outcomes, except sensitivity/warmth which had an inverse association. Parenting factors predicted diagnosis and overall symptoms as well as inattentive and hyperactive symptoms when measured, but multiple factors showed significant heterogeneity across studies. These findings support the possibility that parenting and family environment influences ADHD symptoms and may affect a child's likelihood of being diagnosed with ADHD. Prevention strategies that support parents, such as decreasing parenting challenges and increasing access to parent training in behavior management, may improve children's long-term developmental health.}

  ABSTRACT = {(1) Background: Poor levels of physical fitness and motor skills are problems for today's children. Active video games (AVG) could be an attractive strategy to help address them. The aim was to investigate the effects of AVG on health-related physical fitness and motor competence in children and adolescents with healthy weight. (2) Methods: Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of AVG programs on health-related physical fitness and motor competence were included. Two different quality assessment tools were used to measure the risk of bias. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria and the variables of interest were body mass index (BMI), body fat, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscular fitness and motor competence. (3) Results: AVG interventions seem to have benefits in BMI when lasting longer than 18 weeks (SMD, -0.590; 95\% IC, -1.071, -0.108) and in CRF (SMD, 0.438; 95\% IC, 0.022, 0.855). AVG seems to be a promising tool to improve muscular fitness and motor competence but the effects are still unclear due to the lack of evidence. (4) Conclusions: AVG seem to be an effective tool for improving some components of health-related physical fitness and motor competence in healthy-weight children and adolescents, but the effect on some fitness components needs further research. Therefore, AVG may be included as a strategy to improve health.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Childhood obesity is one of the most important public health problems. Active video games (AVGs) have been proposed as an attractive alternative to increase energy expenditure and are being investigated to determine their effectiveness against childhood obesity.; Objective: The aim of this study is to summarize the existing research and draw conclusions about the effects of AVGs on health-related physical fitness and motor competence in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity.; Methods: The search strategy was applied to PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus, including randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials investigating the effects of AVG programs on health-related physical fitness and motor competence in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. To measure the risk of bias in randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, 2 different quality assessment tools were used. In total, 15 articles met the inclusion criteria, and the variables of interest were BMI, body fat percentage, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), waist circumference, fat-free mass, muscular fitness, and motor competence. A meta-analysis was performed.; Results: Positive effects were found for BMI and body fat percentage, favoring the AVG group compared with a control group with no intervention (mean difference -0.209; 95\% CI -0.388 to -0.031 vs mean difference -0.879; 95\% CI -1.138 to -0.602). Positive effects seem to be observed for CRF. The effects of AVG interventions on muscular fitness, fat-free mass, waist circumference, and motor competence are unclear.; Conclusions: AVG programs showed positive effects on BMI, body fat percentage, and CRF. AVG could be a good strategy to combat childhood obesity.

  ABSTRACT = {Social Networking Sites (SNS) have close to 3 billion users worldwide. Recently, however, SNS have come under media scrutiny for their potential association with depression. Two previous meta-analyses failed to find evidence for a robust concurrent association between SNS use and depression symptoms. However, these analyses focused primarily on the time spent using SNS. The current meta-analysis is the first to consider the multi-dimensional nature of SNS use, and examines separately the quantitative associations of depression symptoms to SNS use in three types of SNS studies examining three distinct constructs of SNS use: time spent using SNS, intensity of SNS use, and problematic SNS use. Sixty-two studies (N = 451, 229) met inclusion criteria. Depression symptoms were significantly, but weakly, associated with time spent using SNS (r = 0.11) and intensity of SNS use (r = 0.09). However, the association of depression symptoms to problematic SNS use was moderate (r = 0.29), was significantly higher than for time spent using SNS (Q(between) = 35.85, p {$<$} 0.001) or intensity of SNS use (Q(between) = 13.95, p {$<$} 0.001), and was not significantly moderated by age, gender, year of study publication, or mode of recruitment. These results suggest that future research examining causal models of the relation of SNS use and depression, as well as research on intervention and prevention, should focus in more detail on individuals who are engaging in a pattern of problematic SNS use.}

  ABSTRACT = {There is a considerable debate on addiction and abuse to Smartphone among adolescents and its consequent impact on their health; not only in a global context, but also specifically in the Indian population; considering that Smartphone's, globally occupy more than 50\% of mobile phones market and more precise quantification of the associated problems is important to facilitate understanding in this field. As per PRISMA (2009) guidelines, extensive search of various studies in any form from a global scale to the more narrow Indian context using two key search words: "Smartphone's addiction" and "Indian adolescents" was done using websites of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Global Health, Psyc-INFO, Biomed-Central, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, world library - World-Cat, Indian libraries such as National Medical Library of India from 1 January, 1995 to March 31, 2014 first for systematic-review. Finally, meta-analysis on only Indian studies was done using Med-Calc online software capable of doing meta-analysis of proportions. A total of 45 articles were considered in systematic-review from whole world; later on 6 studies out of these 45 related to Smartphone's addiction in India were extracted to perform meta-analysis, in which total 1304 participants (range: 165-335) were enrolled. The smartphone addiction magnitude in India ranged from 39\% to 44\% as per fixed effects calculated (P {$<$} 0.0001). Smartphone addiction among Indian teens can not only damage interpersonal skills, but also it can lead to significant negative health risks and harmful psychological effects on Indian adolescents.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Children and adolescents are major computer and technology gadget users. While serious games hold important promises for promoting health-related behavioral change and mental health among children and adolescents, their efficacy is yet unclear. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to offer a comprehensive picture on the evidence-based status of serious games for mental health promotion and health-related behavioral change in children and adolescents. Method: We included 34 clinical and experimental randomized studies investigating the efficacy of serious games on mental health promotion and health-related behavioral change in children and adolescents. Results: Results showed a small, but significant effect size with very high heterogeneity. Participants' age, number of sessions, the length of session, and study quality significantly moderated the effect size, with younger participants, fewer and shorter sessions, and lower quality of the study being associated with higher effect sizes. The effect size was not significant for follow-up measurements. Conclusions: The evidence supporting the use of serious games in children and adolescents for purposes of health promotion is limited. These conclusions must be considered with caution given the bias of publication. We need more adequately conducted studies testing well-specified serious games before we can draw clear conclusions.}

  ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of virtual technologies, there is a growing body of literature investigating the impact of virtual technologies on students' spatial ability. However, it remains unclear whether virtual technologies can effectively improve students' spatial ability. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the findings on the overall effects of virtual-based spatial ability enhancement. We systematically searched literature published from 2010 to 2020 (excluding non-empirical articles) and found 36 experimental peer-reviewed journal articles that met the inclusion criteria. Then, the random-effects model (REM) was used to calculate the pooled effect size. Results showed that virtual technologies have a medium effect on developing spatial ability with an overall effect size of 0.617. The studies were also coded to examine the moderating effects of their characteristics, such as learner stage, virtual technologies, disciplines, experimental design, learning application types, spatial ability, and testing instruments, on the outcome measure. The moderator analysis indicated that the virtual-based spatial ability improvement was more effective (a) for preschool learners, (b) in the fields of natural science and engineering technologies, (c) for all types of spatial ability, and (d) when learning during 3 to 6~months. Furthermore, augmented reality was most conducive to improving learners' spatial ability compared with other virtual technologies. These findings provided insights for future studies and practices on using virtual technologies to cultivate spatial ability.}

  ABSTRACT = {Importance Currently, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the association between screen time (eg, television, video games) and children's behavior problems. Objective To assess the association between the duration of screen time and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems among children 12 years or younger. Data Sources For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published from January 1960 to May 2021. Reference lists were manually searched for additional studies. Study Selection Included studies measured screen time (ie, duration) and externalizing or internalizing behavior problems in children 12 years or younger, were observational or experimental (with baseline data), were available in English, and had data that could be transformed into an effect size. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded. Of 25 196 nonduplicate articles identified and screened for inclusion, 595 met the selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Extracted variables were child age, sex, and socioeconomic status; informants and measurement type for screen time and behavior problems; study publication year; and study design and quality. Data were extracted by 2 independent coders and were pooled using a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the association of screen time duration with externalizing (eg, aggression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms) and internalizing (eg, depression, anxiety) behaviors or diagnoses. Results Of the 595 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 87 studies met all inclusion criteria, comprising 98 independent samples and 159 425 participants (mean [SD] age, 6.07 [2.89] years; 83 246 [51.30\%] male). Increased duration of screen time had a small but significant correlation with more externalizing problems (90 samples; r, 0.11; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.12) and internalizing problems (43 samples; r, 0.07; 95\% CI, 0.05-0.08) in children. Several methodological moderators explained between-study heterogeneity. There was evidence of significant between study heterogeneity (I2\,=\,87.80). Conclusions and Relevance This systematic review and meta-analysis found small but significant correlations between screen time and children's behavior problems. Methodological differences across studies likely contributed to the mixed findings in the literature.}

  ABSTRACT = {Professional advocacy associations such as the American Psychological Association (APA) and American Academy of Pediatrics commonly release policy statements regarding science and behavior. Policymakers and the general public may assume that such statements reflect objective conclusions, but their actual fidelity in representing science remains largely untested. For example, in recent decades, policy statements related to media effects have been released with increasing regularity. However, they have often provoked criticisms that they do not adequately reflect the state of the science on media effects. The News Media, Public Education and Public Policy Committee (a standing committee of APA's Division 46, the Media Psychology and Technology division) reviewed all publicly available policy statements on media effects produced by professional organizations and evaluated them using a standardized rubric. It was found that current policy statements tend to be more definitive than is warranted by the underlying science, and often ignore conflicting research results. These findings have broad implications for policy statements more generally, outside the field of media effects. In general, the committee suggests that professional organizations run the risk of misinforming the public when they release policy statements that do not acknowledge debates and inconsistencies in a field, or limitations of methodology. In formulating policy statements, advocacy organizations may wish to focus less on claiming consensus and more on acknowledging areas of agreement, areas of disagreement, and limitations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Purpose: The purpose of this review was to assess the effect of active video games among overweight and obese adolescents.Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using records from the English-language electronic databases MEDLINE, the Web of Science, and PubMed. These databases were searched from January 2010 to December 2020 using the keywords (adolescent*) AND (overweight OR obese *) AND (active video games OR exergaming * OR video game*).Results: Five articles met the inclusion criteria. Four studies were conducted in the United States of America and 1 study was conducted in Canada. In addition, all included articles had a randomized controlled trial study design. It was determined that the sample size of the studies was 30\textendash 46 participants and there were a total of 195 overweight and obese adolescents across the included studies. Active video gaming was negatively associated with changes in body mass index percentile (mean difference [MD], -1.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.55 to -0.99; p{$<$}0.001) and total cholesterol (MD, -11.16; 95\% CI, -16.64 to -5.68; p{$<$}0.001).Conclusion: Playing active video games can reduce both the body mass index percentile and total cholesterol in overweight and obese adolescents. Active video games can provide a different method for combating childhood obesity. High-quality randomized controlled trials are recommended to assess the impact of game-based interventions.}

  ABSTRACT = {This systematic review examined the compliance with the 24-h movement guidelines, and investigated its associations with health indicators for healthy children under 5~years of age. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus were searched for peer-reviewed studies and the last search was conducted on 27 October 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scales were used to assess the quality of included studies. Eighteen articles including 8,943 participants from 11 countries were included. On average around 13\% of the children met all three guidelines. Meta-analyses of the associations between meeting all three guidelines and adiposity yielded no significant results (r = - 0.03; 95\% CI~= - 0.12, 0.06; I(2)~=~51\%; P =~0.48). Meeting more guidelines was associated with better psychosocial health (3/4 studies). Associations between meeting individual or combined guidelines and motor development yielded mixed results (2/2 studies), while no associations between meeting guidelines and cognitive development were observed (1 study). Compliance with all three guidelines was low. Further evidence is required to understand the associations between meeting the 24-h movement guidelines and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there was evidence of a dose-response relationship between meeting the guidelines and better psychosocial health in the early years.}

  ABSTRACT = {The issue of whether video games\textemdash violent or nonviolent\textemdash ``harm'' children and adolescents continues to be hotly contested in the scientific community, among politicians, and in the general public. To date, researchers have focused on college student samples in most studies on video games, often with poorly standardized outcome measures. To answer questions about harm to minors, these studies are arguably not very illuminating. In the current analysis, I sought to address this gap by focusing on studies of video game influences on child and adolescent samples. The effects of overall video game use and exposure to violent video games specifically were considered, although this was not an analysis of pathological game use. Overall, results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences on increased aggression ( r = .06), reduced prosocial behavior ( r = .04), reduced academic performance ( r = -.01), depressive symptoms ( r = .04), and attention deficit symptoms ( r = .03) are minimal. Issues related to researchers' degrees of freedom and citation bias also continue to be common problems for the field. Publication bias remains a problem for studies of aggression. Recommendations are given on how research may be improved and how the psychological community should address video games from a public health perspective.}

  ABSTRACT = {In 2015, the American Psychological Association (APA) released a task-force technical report on video-game violence with a concurrent resolution statement linking violent games to aggression but not violent crime. The task-force report has proven to be controversial; many scholars have criticized language implying conclusive evidence linking violent games to aggression as well as technical concerns regarding the meta-analysis that formed the basis of the technical report and resolution statement. In the current article, we attempt a reevaluation of the 2015 technical report meta-analysis. The intent of this reevaluation was to examine whether the data foundations behind the APA's resolution on video-game violence were sound. Reproducing the original meta-analysis proved difficult because some studies were included that did not appear to have relevant data, and many other available studies were not included. The current analysis revealed negligible relationships between violent games and aggressive or prosocial behavior, small relationships with aggressive affect and cognitions, and stronger relationships with desensitization. However, effect sizes appeared to be elevated because of non-best-practices and researcher-expectancy effects, particularly for experimental studies. It is concluded that evidence warrants a more cautious interpretation of the effects of violent games on aggression than provided by the APA technical report or resolution statement.}

  ABSTRACT = {The question of whether screen time, particularly time spent with social media and smartphones, influences mental health outcomes remains a topic of considerable debate among policy makers, the public, and scholars. Some scholars have argued passionately that screen media may be contributing to an increase in poor psychosocial functioning and risk of suicide, particularly among teens. Other scholars contend that the evidence is not yet sufficient to support such a dramatic conclusion. The current meta-analysis included 37 effect sizes from 33 separate studies. To consider the most recent research, all studies analyzed were published between 2015 and 2019. Across studies, evidence suggests that screen media plays little role in mental health concerns. In particular, there was no evidence that screen media contribute to suicidal ideation or other mental health outcomes. This result was also true when investigating smartphones or social media specifically. Overall, as has been the case for previous media such as video games, concerns about screen time and mental health are not based in reliable data.

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Technology holds promise for delivery of accessible, individualized, and destigmatized obesity prevention and treatment to youth. Objective(s): This review examined the efficacy of recent technology-based interventions on weight outcomes. Method(s): Seven databases were searched in April 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were: participants aged 1-18 y, use of technology in a prevention/treatment intervention for overweight/obesity; weight outcome; randomized controlled trial (RCT); and published after January 2014. Random effects models with inverse variance weighting estimated pooled mean effect sizes separately for treatment and prevention interventions. Meta-regressions examined the effect of technology type (telemedicine or technology-based), technology purpose (stand-alone or adjunct), comparator (active or no-contact control), delivery (to parent, child, or both), study type (pilot or not), child age, and intervention duration. Finding(s): In total, 3406 records were screened for inclusion; 55 studies representing 54 unique RCTs met inclusion criteria. Most (89\%) included articles were of high or moderate quality. Thirty studies relied mostly or solely on technology for intervention delivery. Meta-analyses of the 20 prevention RCTs did not show a significant effect of prevention interventions on weight outcomes (d = 0.05, p = 0.52). The pooled mean effect size of n = 32 treatment RCTs showed a small, significant effect on weight outcomes (d = -0.13, p = 0.001), although 27 of 33 treatment studies (79\%) did not find significant differences between treatment and comparators. There were significantly greater treatment effects on outcomes for pilot interventions, interventions delivered to the child compared to parent-delivered interventions, and as child age increased and intervention duration decreased. No other subgroup analyses were significant. Conclusion(s): Recent technology-based interventions for the treatment of pediatric obesity show small effects on weight; however, evidence is inconclusive on the efficacy of technology based prevention interventions. Research is needed to determine the comparative effectiveness of technology-based interventions to gold-standard interventions and elucidate the potential for mHealth/eHealth to increase scalability and reduce costs while maximizing impact.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.}

  ABSTRACT = {Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted\textemdash the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size ( r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.}

  ABSTRACT = {This meta-analysis examines the inconsistent findings across experimental studies that compared children's learning outcomes with digital and paper books. We quantitatively reviewed 39 studies reported in 30 articles (n = 1,812 children) and compared children's story comprehension and vocabulary learning in relation to medium (reading on paper versus on-screen), design enhancements in digital books, the presence of a dictionary, and adult support for children aged between 1 and 8 years. The comparison of digital versus paper books that only differed by digitization showed lower comprehension scores for digital books. Adults' mediation during print books' reading was more effective than the enhancements in digital books read by children independently. However, with story-congruent enhancements, digital books outperformed paper books. An embedded dictionary had no or negative effect on children's story comprehension but positively affected children's vocabulary learning. Findings are discussed in relation to the cognitive load theory and practical design implications.}

  ABSTRACT = {Adolescents' Internet use is increasingly mobile, private, and unsupervised, which raises concerns given that the Internet increasingly serves as a medium for experiencing victimization. Although it is widely recognized that in-person victimization has a deleterious effect on adolescents' educational outcomes, the extent to which cyber-victimization has similar effects is less well known. This systematic review and meta-analysis offers a synthesis of the relationship between cyber-victimization and educational outcomes of adolescents aged 12 to 17, including 25 effect sizes from 12 studies drawn from a variety of disciplines. A series of random-effects meta-analyses using robust variance estimation revealed associations between cyber-victimization and higher school attendance problems (r = .20) and academic achievement problems (r = .14). Results did not differ by provided definition, publication status, reporting time frame, gender, race/ethnicity, or average age. Implications for future research are discussed within context of theoretical, critical, and applied discussions.}

  ABSTRACT = {This article is the first of a series providing guidance for use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system of rating quality of evidence and grading strength of recommendations in systematic reviews, health technology assessments (HTAs), and clinical practice guidelines addressing alternative management options. The GRADE process begins with asking an explicit question, including specification of all important outcomes. After the evidence is collected and summarized, GRADE provides explicit criteria for rating the quality of evidence that include study design, risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and magnitude of effect. Recommendations are characterized as strong or weak (alternative terms conditional or discretionary) according to the quality of the supporting evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the alternative management options. GRADE suggests summarizing evidence in succinct, transparent, and informative summary of findings tables that show the quality of evidence and the magnitude of relative and absolute effects for each important outcome and/or as evidence profiles that provide, in addition, detailed information about the reason for the quality of evidence rating. Subsequent articles in this series will address GRADE's approach to formulating questions, assessing quality of evidence, and developing recommendations.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a critical period in human life, associated with reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behaviors. In this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis, we evaluated the association between screen time and risk of overweight/obesity among adolescents. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Scopus was performed up to September 2021. All published studies evaluating the association between screen time and risk of overweight/obesity among adolescents were retrieved. Finally, a total of 44 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The results of the two-class meta-analysis showed that adolescents at the highest category of screen time were 1.27 times more likely to develop overweight/obesity (OR\,=\,1.273; 95\% CI\,=\,1.166-1.390; P\,{$<$}\,0.001; I-squared (variation in ES attributable to heterogeneity)\,=\,82.1\%). The results of subgrouping showed that continent and setting were the possible sources of heterogeneity. Moreover, no evidence of non-linear association between increased screen time and risk of overweight/obesity among adolescents was observed (P-nonlinearity\,=\,0.311). CONCLUSION: For the first time, the current systematic review and meta-analysis revealed a positive association between screen time and overweight/obesity among adolescents without any dose-response evidence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol of the current work has been registered in the PROSPERO system (Registration number: CRD42021233899 ).}

  ABSTRACT = {This meta-analysis reviewed research between 2012 and 2018 focused on technology-assisted second language (L2) vocabulary learning for English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. A total of 45 studies of 2,374 preschool-to-college EFL students contributed effect sizes to this meta-analysis. Compared with traditional instructional methods, the overall effect of technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning was large (g =.845), suggesting that technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning was more beneficial than non-technology-assisted instruction. Importantly, within-study comparison results indicated that technology could enhance learners' long-term vocabulary retention. Moderator analysis results highlight several variables\textemdash namely, device type, game condition, setting, test format, and reported reliability\textemdash affecting the effectiveness of vocabulary learning. Specifically, advantages were found for mobile devices and on-the-move learning, suggesting that L2 vocabulary learning may be most efficient when students use mobile phones and are not restricted by classroom settings. These variables should be considered when planning instruction in technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: About 70\% of children and adolescents worldwide do not meet the recommended level of physical activity (PA), which is closely associated with physical, psychological, and cognitive well-being. Nowadays, the use of technologies to change PA is of interest due to the need for novel, more effective intervention approaches. The previous meta-analyses have examined smartphone-based interventions and their impact on PA in adults, but evidence in children and adolescents still needs further research.; Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions for improving PA in children and adolescents.; Methods: Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, OVID, Scopus, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched up to June 29, 2020. Randomized controlled trials with a control group that examine the effect of smartphone interventions on PA among children and adolescents were included. Bias risks were assessed using the Cochrane collaboration tool. Meta-analysis was performed to assess the pooled effect on PA using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the potential modifying effects of different factors (eg, types of intervention, intervention duration, age, measurement, study quality).; Results: A total of 9 studies were included in this review, including 4 mobile app interventions, 3 SMS text messaging interventions, and 2 app + SMS text messaging interventions. In general, the risk of bias of included studies was low. Compared with the control group, the use of smartphone intervention significantly improved PA (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.44, 95\% CI 0.11-0.77, P=.009), especially for total PA (TPA; weighted mean difference [WMD] 32.35, 95\% CI 10.36-54.33, P=.004) and daily steps (WMD 1185, 95\% CI 303-2068, P=.008), but not for moderate-to-vigorous PA (WMD 3.91, 95\% CI -1.99 to 9.81, P=.19). High statistical heterogeneity was detected (I 2 =73.9\%, P{$<$}.001) for PA. Meta-regression showed that duration ({$\beta$}=-.08, 95\% CI -0.15 to -0.01, n=16) was a potential factor for high heterogeneity. The results of subgroup analyses indicated that app intervention (SMD 0.76, 95\% CI 0.23-1.30, P=.005), children (SMD 0.64, 95\% CI 0.10-1.18, P=.02), "{$\leq$}8 weeks" (SMD 0.76, 95\% CI 0.23-1.30, P=.005), objective measurement (SMD 0.50, 95\% CI 0.09-0.91, P=.02), and low risk of bias (SMD 0.96, 95\% CI 0.38-1.54, P=.001) can significantly improve PA.; Conclusions: The evidence of meta-analysis shows that smartphone-based intervention may be a promising strategy to increase TPA and steps in children and adolescents. Currently, app intervention may be a more effective strategy among smartphone intervention technologies. To extend the promise of smartphone intervention, the future needs to design comparative trials among different smartphone technologies.; Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42019148261; https://tinyurl.com/y5modsrd.

  ABSTRACT = {Objective: To study the impact of active video games on Body Mass Index (BMI) in children and adolescents. Design and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Data were pooled in meta-analysis using the method of random effects or fixed effects, as appropriate, after examination of statistical heterogeneity. Data sources and eligibility criteria for selecting studies. A comprehensive literature research was conducted in Medline (PubMed), ISI web of Knowledge, and SCOPUS up to April 2018, in relation to clinical trials (both controlled and non-controlled) in children and adolescents, whose intervention was based on active video games. Results: The overall intragroup effect of the intervention based on active video games was in favor of the intervention, reaching statistical significance using the fixed effects model: (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.138; 95\% CI (-0.237 to -0.038), p = 0.007 and was of borderline statistical significance in the random effects model: SMD= -0.191; 95\% CI (-0.386 to 0.003), p = 0.053. The individual results of the determinations of the 15 included studies for this analysis showed a high heterogeneity among them (I2 = 82.91\%). When the intervention was applied to children and adolescents with greater than or equal to 85 (overweight or obese) BMI percentile showed a greater effect in favor of the active video games: SMD= -0.483, p = 0.012. The overall intra-group effect in the control group was close to zero (SMD = 0.087). With respect to the non-standardized mean difference (MD) between groups, it was also in favor of active video games for both BMI (Kg/m2): DM = -0.317, 95\% CI (-0.442 to -0.193), p = {$<$} 0.001 and BMI z-score: DM = -0.077, 95\% CI (-0.139 to -0.016), p = 0.013. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis show a statistically significant effect in favor of using active video games on BMI in children and adolescents. The clinical relevance of this positive effect must be evaluated.}

  ABSTRACT = {We synthesized evidence on the effectiveness of active video games (AVGs) versus no AVG-applied comparators on various physical activity (PA) levels and weight management outcomes in children and adolescents. We analyzed the comparative evidence on different sub-categories of AVGs and ranking the best option. An overview of systematic reviews (SRs) and network meta-analysis (NMA) (PROSPERO: CRD42021248499) was employed. A search for relevant literature published in English was conducted in six electronic databases from their inception until April 2021. SRs consisting of randomized control trials (RCTs) and satisfying our PICOS inclusion criteria were included. RCTs included were a comparison of groups among children and adolescents between 6 and 21, where groups with AVG interventions were compared with groups without them. Direct head-to-head pairwise meta-analyses were conducted using weighted mean difference between the two groups, and the comparative effectiveness of different sub-categories of AVGs was analyzed indirectly using NMA. Overall, 17 SRs were identified from the 6036 screened citations. Of these, 350 citations were retrieved, and 12 RCTs were finally included. Compared with no AVG group, AVG groups were shown to be more effective in achieving vigorous, moderate-to-vigorous, and moderate PA levels, and decreased BMI and body fat. NMA showed that rhythmic dance games had the highest probability of being the most effective sub-category for reducing BMI. AVGs are effective in attaining vigorous, moderate to vigorous, and moderate PA levels, and reducing BMI and body fat among children and adolescents. Dance appears to be the best option for reducing BMI among AVG subcategories.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background The published clinical research literature may be distorted by the pursuit of statistically significant results.             Purpose We aimed to develop a test to explore biases stemming from the pursuit of nominal statistical significance.             Methods The exploratory test evaluates whether there is a relative excess of formally significant findings in the published literature due to any reason (e.g., publication bias, selective analyses and outcome reporting, or fabricated data). The number of expected studies with statistically significant results is estimated and compared against the number of observed significant studies. The main application uses {$\alpha$} = 0.05, but a range of {$\alpha$} thresholds is also examined. Different values or prior distributions of the effect size are assumed. Given the typically low power (few studies per research question), the test may be best applied across domains of many meta-analyses that share common characteristics (interventions, outcomes, study populations, research environment).             Results We evaluated illustratively eight meta-analyses of clinical trials with {$>$}50 studies each and 10 meta-analyses of clinical efficacy for neuroleptic agents in schizophrenia; the 10 meta-analyses were also examined as a composite domain. Different results were obtained against commonly used tests of publication bias. We demonstrated a clear or possible excess of significant studies in 6 of 8 large meta-analyses and in the wide domain of neuroleptic treatments.             Limitations The proposed test is exploratory, may depend on prior assumptions, and should be applied cautiously.             Conclusions An excess of significant findings may be documented in some clinical research fields. Clinical Trials 2007; 4: 245\textemdash 253; http://ctj.sagepub.com}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: The association of adolescent social media use with mental health symptoms, especially depression, has recently attracted a great deal of interest in public media as well as the scientific community. Some studies have cited statistically significant associations between adolescent social media use and depression and have proposed that parents must regulate their adolescents' social media use in order to protect their mental health.; Method: In order to rigorously assess the size of the effect that has been reported in the current scientific literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured the association between social media use specifically and depressive symptoms amongst early- to mid- adolescents (11-18 years-old). We searched Psychnet, PubMed, and Web of Science with the following terms: online social networks, social media, internet usage, facebook, twitter, instagram, myspace, snapchat, and depression.; Results: We found a small but significant positive correlation (k=12 studies, r=.11, p{$<$}.01) between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms. There was also high heterogeneity (I 2 =95.22\%) indicating substantial variation among studies.; Conclusions: High heterogeneity along with the small overall effect size observed in the relationship between self-reported social media use and depressive symptoms suggests that other factors are likely to act as significant moderators of the relationship. We suggest that future research should be focused on understanding which types of use may be harmful (or helpful) to mental health, rather than focusing on overall use measures that likely reflect highly heterogeneous exposures.

  ABSTRACT = {Debates concerning the impacts of screen time are widespread. Existing research presents mixed findings, and lacks longitudinal evidence for any causal or long-term effects. We present a critical account of the current shortcomings of the screen time literature. These include poor conceptualisation, the use of non-standardised measures that are predominantly self-report, and issues with measuring screen time over time and context. Based on these issues, we make a series of recommendations as a basis for furthering academic and public debate. These include drawing on a user-focused approach in order to seek the various affordances gained from ``screen use''. Within this, we can better understand the way in which these vary across time and context, and make distinction between objective measures of ``screen time'' compared to those more subjective experiences of uses or affordances, and the differential impacts these may bring.}

  ABSTRACT = {Thousands of educational apps are available to students, teachers, and parents, yet research on their effectiveness is limited. This meta-analysis synthesized findings from 36 intervention studies and 285 effect sizes evaluating the effectiveness of educational apps for preschool to Grade 3 children and the moderating role of methodological, participant, and intervention characteristics. Using random effects meta-regression with robust variance estimation, we summarized the overall impact of educational apps and examined potential moderator effects. First, results from rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental studies yielded a mean weighted effect size of +0.31 standard deviations on overall achievement and comparable effects in both math and literacy. Second, the positive overall effect masks substantial variability in app effectiveness, as meta-regression analyses revealed three significant moderators of treatment effects. Treatment effects were larger for studies involving preschool rather than K\textendash 3 students, for studies using researcher-developed rather than standardized outcomes, and for studies measuring constrained rather than unconstrained skills.}

  ABSTRACT = {Problematic gaming has been linked to poor sleep outcomes; however, these associations have not yet been synthesized quantitatively. This review employed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between problematic gaming and sleep-related outcomes. A search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar identified a total of 763 studies, including 34 studies (               n               = 51,901 participants) eligible for inclusion. Papers were included if available in any European language, addressed problematic gaming, contained original data, and provided sufficient data for calculation of effect sizes. Two researchers independently extracted data using pre-defined fields including quality assessment. Sleep-related outcomes were meta-analyzed for sleep parameters that were reported by 5 or more papers. Significant overall effects were found for sleep duration (               g               = -0.238, 95\%               CI               = -0.364, -0.112), poor sleep quality (               OR               = 2.02, 95\%               CI               = 1.47, 2.78), daytime sleepiness (               OR               = 1.57, 95\%               CI               = 1.00, 2.46) and sleep problems (               OR               = 2.60, 95\%               CI               = 1.94, 3.47). Between-study heterogeneity was detected for all meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed a higher inverse effect size for adolescent samples compared to adult or non-specific age samples in terms of sleep duration. For daytime sleepiness, a larger effect size was found for studies based on single-item sleep measures compared to multi-item sleep measures. For sleep problems, the subgroup analysis showed the opposite with a higher effect size for studies based on single-item sleep measures than multi-item sleep measures. Across all sleep parameters, problematic gamers consistently reported a more adverse sleep status than non-problematic gamers.

  ABSTRACT = {This article presents the results of a meta-analysis of 58 studies of mathematics interventions for elementary students with special needs. Interventions in three different domains were selected: preparatory mathematics, basic skills, and problem-solving strategies. The majority of the included studies described interventions in the domain of basic skills. In general, these interventions were also the most effective. Furthermore, a few specific characteristics were found to influence the outcomes of the studies. In addition to the duration of the intervention, the particular method of intervention proved important: Direct instruction and self-instruction were found to be more effective than mediated instruction. Interventions involving the use of computer-assisted instruction and peer tutoring showed smaller effects than interventions not including these supports.}

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract                            Background               Proficiency in gross motor skills (GMS) lays the foundation for developing more complex motor skills. Improving these motor skills may provide enhanced opportunities for the development of a variety of perceptual, social, and cognitive skills. However, GMS development and intervention effects are not ideal for many non-typically developing children.                                         Objective               To systematically evaluate the effect of active video games on the development of gross motor skills in non-typically developing children and adolescents.                                         Methods               Seven Chinese and English databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, and the risk of bias in included studies were qualitative evaluation according to the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Then a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall effect of active video games on the development of gross motor skills in non-typically developing children.                                         Results               Twenty papers were included. In the three subordinate concepts of gross motor skills, active video games significantly improved locomotor skills [ SMD\,=\,0.59, 95\% CI (0.40, 0.77)] and non-locomotor skills [SMD\,=\,0.51, 95\% CI (0.20, 0.81)] in non-typically developing children. However, there was no significant difference compared with the control group [ SMD\,=\,0.32, 95\% CI (-~0.17, 0.82)] in object control skills.                                         Conclusions               The study shows that active video games can improve locomotor skill and stability skill in non-typically developing children, but the effect on object control skill is uncertain, and more high-quality literature needs to be included in the future.

  ABSTRACT = {Evidence suggests that excessive screen time in early childhood is related to children's physical and mental health. This study aimed to review the relationships between screen media use and several health indicators in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. A systematic search was conducted by two independent reviewers on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify the eligible studies, with an end date of 13 August 2019. Included studies (published in English) were peer-reviewed and met the determinate population (children aged 0\textendash 7 years with screen media exposure and related health outcomes). The AHRQ, NOS, and the Cochrane Handbook were used to evaluate the cross-sectional study, cohort study, and RCT, respectively. A meta-analysis and narrative syntheses were employed separately. Eighty studies (23 studies for meta-analysis) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Strong evidence of the meta-analysis suggested that excessive screen time was associated with overweight/obesity and shorter sleep duration among toddlers and preschoolers. Excessive screen use was associated with various health indicators in physical, behavioral, and psychosocial aspects. Better-quality research on newer media devices, on various kinds of contents in young children, and on dose\textendash response relationships between excessive screen use and health indicators are needed to update recommendations of screen use.}

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract             The puzzle of whether digital media are improving or harming psychological well-being has been plaguing researchers and the public for decades. Derived from media richness theory, this study proposed that phone calls and texting improve well-being, while use of social network sites (SNSs), instant messaging (IM), and online gaming may displace other social contacts and, thereby, impair well-being. To test this hypothesis, a meta-analysis of 124 studies was conducted. The results showed that phone calls and texting were positively correlated with well-being, whereas online gaming was negatively associated with well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between digital media use and well-being was also contingent upon the way the technology was used. A series of meta-analyses of different types of SNS use and well-being was used to elucidate this point: interaction, self-presentation, and entertainment on SNSs were associated with better well-being, whereas consuming SNSs' content was associated with poorer well-being.}

  ABSTRACT = {Creativity is essential for the sustainable development of both individuals and organizations. The constant permeation of technology into everyday life is expected to facilitate the cultivation of creativity. To date, no consistent answer has been reached regarding the effect of technology on creativity. This study conducted a three-level random-effects meta-analysis to explore this question. An examination of a sample of 50 studies with 322 effect sizes yielded a moderate positive effect (g = 0.59, 95\% CI [0.38, 0.81]). Moderation analysis revealed that the effect was moderated by human-computer interaction, domain, measures of creativity, study design, intervention time, and randomization. Specifically, technologies requiring human-computer interaction led to a greater effect size than those requiring only passive watching. A larger effect was found for creativity in math than in other domains. Effects on originality, elaboration, and overall creativity were greater than those on fluency and flexibility. The effect was larger for studies using a pretest-posttest control group design than those using a posttest control group design. Experiments using a quasi-experimental rather than a randomized experimental design resulted in a lower effect size. Technology interventions spanning a medium or long period displayed a greater positive effect than short-term interventions. These findings confirmed the positive effect of technology on creativity, providing practical implications for creativity educators and researchers.}

  ABSTRACT = {Social networking sites offer new avenues for interpersonal communication that may enable people to build social capital. The meta-analyses reported in this paper evaluated the relationship between social network site (SNS) use and 2 types of social capital: bridging social capital and bonding social capital. The meta-analyses included data from 58 articles gathered through scholarly databases and a hand search of the early publications of relevant journals. Using a random effects model, the overall effect size of the relationship between SNS use and bridging social capital based on k = 50 studies and N = 22,290 participants was r = .32 (95\% CI [.27, .37]), and the overall effect size between SNS use and bonding social capital based on k = 43 studies and N = 19,439 participants was r = .26 (95\% CI [.22, .31]). The relationships between SNS use and both types of social capital were stronger in men than in women, and the relationship between SNS use and bridging capital was stronger in Western, individualistic countries than Eastern, collectivistic countries. Additional analyses of specific SNS activities indicated that SNS use promotes social capital by facilitating contact and interaction among people who already know each other offline rather than contact with people who were met online. The implication is that SNSs offer a platform to strengthen existing relationships.}

  ABSTRACT = {Adolescent depression is a worldwide public health concern and has contributed to significant socioeconomic burden. Investigating the association between time spent on social media (TSSM) and depression may provide guidance toward the prevention and intervention of adolescent depression. However, related literature reported mixed findings in terms of the relationship between TSSM and depression in adolescents. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive dose\textendash response meta-analysis to clarify this issue. We conducted a systematic title/abstract and topic search of the relative terms in Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO databases through 9 January 2022. Odd ratios (ORs) were used to examine the pooled effect size of the association between TSSM and risk of depression. Dose\textendash response analysis was evaluated by a generalized least squares trend estimation. Twenty-one cross-sectional studies and five longitudinal studies including a total of 55,340 participants were included. Overall, more TSSM was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression symptoms (OR = 1.60, 95\%CI: 1.45 to 1.75) with high heterogeneity (Q(29) = 105.9, p {$<$} 0.001; I2 = 72.6\%). The association was stronger for adolescent girls (OR = 1.72, 95\%CI: 1.41 to 2.09) than boys (OR = 1.20, 95\%CI: 1.05 to 1.37). Five studies with seven reports were included in dose\textendash response analysis. There was a linear dose\textendash response association of TSSM and risk of depression. The risk of depression increased by 13\% (OR = 1.13, 95\%CI: 1.09 to 1.17, p {$<$} 0.001) for each hour increase in social media use in adolescents. TSSM is associated with depression in a linear dose\textendash response and gender-specific manner, which suggests the need for better monitoring of adolescent social media use. However, motivation, content, and engagement on and exposure to social media use may also be important contributing factors, making it necessary to interpret the current findings with caution. Therefore, further research is required to clarify not only the causal link between TSSM and depression by randomized control studies but also the influence of other factors, such as active vs. passive social media use or different types of engagement or environments in which social media is used.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Mobile phone addiction has become a social problem that affects the healthy growth of adolescents, and it may be correlated with coping style. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mobile phone addiction and coping style and the influencing factors for adolescents.; Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted by searching China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANFANG DATA and Chongqing VIP Information Co., Ltd. (VIP), PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO. Stata 16.0 was used to analyse the overall effect and test the moderating effect.; Results: Thirty-three studies were included, involving a total of 20,349 subjects. There was no significant correlation between adolescents' mobile phone addiction and positive coping style (r\,=\,\,-\,0.02, 95\% CI\,=\,\,-\,0.06 to 0.02, P\,{$>$}\,0.05), but there was a moderate positive correlation between adolescents' mobile phone addiction and negative coping style (r\,=\,0.31, 95\% CI\,=\,0.26 to 0.36, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The moderating effect analysis showed that the effect of dissertations on mobile phone addiction and positive coping style among adolescents was significantly larger than that of journal articles.~The Smartphone Addiction Scale for College Students (SAS-C) showed the largest effect on mobile phone addiction and positive coping style among adolescents. The time of publication significantly positively moderated the relationship between mobile phone addiction and negative coping style among adolescents. The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) showed the largest effect on adolescents' mobile phone addiction and negative coping style.~However, the correlation between adolescents' mobile phone addiction and coping style was not affected by age or gender.; Conclusions: There was a close relationship between mobile phone addiction and coping style among adolescents. In the future, longitudinal research should be carried out to better investigate the dynamic changes in the relationship between mobile phone addiction and coping style. (\textcopyright{} 2021.

  ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing evidence in literature addressing the relationship between video game participation and loneliness. The following databases were searched on October 2, 2021: Medline, Psychinfo, SportDiscus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. The risk of bias of cross-sectional study was assessed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies with attrition bias added for longitudinal studies. The results of all included studies were synthesized using narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis was utilized to synthesis the findings of the studies that had sufficient degree of statistical and methodological homogeneity. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review, which comprised of 20,372 participants. The narrative synthesis showed mixed findings on the relationship between video game participation and loneliness. Meta-analysis that was conducted to nine cross-sectional studies revealed that video game participation was positively and weakly associated with loneliness (               r               = 0.10, 95\% CI = 0.03\textendash 0.17). Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies demonstrated serious risk of bias with the addition of serious inconsistency of findings from cross-sectional studies. The existing literature is equivocal in terms of making a definitive judgment on the association between video game participation and loneliness.

  ABSTRACT = {Digital technology offers the potential to address educational challenges in resource-poor settings. This meta-analysis examines the impact of students' use of technology that personalises and adapts to learning level in low- and middle-income countries. Following a systematic search for research between 2007 and 2020, 16 randomised controlled trials were identified in five countries. Studies involved 53,029 learners aged 6\textendash 15 years. Coding examined learning domain (mathematics and literacy); personalisation level and delivery; technology use; and intervention duration and intensity. Overall, technology-supported personalised learning was found to have a statistically significant\textemdash if moderate\textemdash positive effect size of 0.18 on learning (p = 0.001). Meta-regression reveals how more personalised approaches which adapt or adjust to learners' level led to significantly greater impact (an effect size of 0.35) than those only linking to learners' interests or providing personalised feedback, support, and/or assessment. Avenues for future research include investigating cost implications, optimum programme length, and teachers' role in making personalised learning with technology effective. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic?Promoting personalised learning is an established aim of educators.Using technology to support personalised learning in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could play an important role in ensuring more inclusive and equitable access to education, particularly in the aftermath of COVID-19.There is currently no rigorous overview of evidence on the effectiveness of using technology to enable personalised learning in LMICs.What this paper adds?The meta-analysis is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-supported personalised learning in improving learning outcomes for school-aged children in LMICs.Technology-supported personalised learning has a statistically significant, positive effect on learning outcomes.Interventions are similarly effective for mathematics and literacy and whether or not teachers also have an active role in the personalisation.Personalised approaches that adapt or adjust to the learner led to significantly greater impact, although whether these warrant the additional investment likely necessary for implementation at scale needs to be investigated.Personalised technology implementation of moderate duration and intensity had similar positive effects to that of stronger duration and intensity, although further research is needed to confirm this.Implications for practice and/or policy:The inclusion of more adaptive personalisation features in technology-assisted learning environments can lead to greater learning gains.Personalised technology approaches featuring moderate personalisation may also yield learning rewards.While it is not known whether personalised technology can be scaled in a cost-effective and contextually appropriate way, there are indications that this is possible.The appropriateness of teachers integrating personalised approaches in their practice should be explored given 'supplementary' uses of personalised technology (ie, additional sessions involving technology outside of regular instruction) are common.

  ABSTRACT = {The current study provides the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations of smart-phone and tablet use with psychosocial, cognitive, and sleep-related factors in early childhood develop-ment. The meta-analysis aimed to provide an overall assessment of the evidence while the systematic review offered a rich overview of the methodological approaches adopted to assess these associations. Studies were included in the review if they examined the association of smartphone or tablet use with a measure of psychosocial development, cognitive development, or sleep in toddlers or preschoolers. Out of 1050 articles that were initially identified, 26 studies were included in the final sample of the systematic review, of which 19 were included in the meta-analysis. Data were screened, extracted, and synthesized according to PRISMA guidelines. A random-effects meta-analysis of correlations found a significant yet weak association of increased smartphone and tablet use with poorer overall child developmental factors. Additionally, a similar but stronger association was found between parental perceptions of problematic device use and poorer overall child factors. Meta-correlations with device use were significant for sleep, but not for psychosocial and cognitive factors. Overall, the results suggest that longitudinal cohort and ex-perimental investigations would elucidate more causal relationships of child factors with smartphone and tablet use. Employing multiple methods of screen-use assessment, and considering the multiple levels of proximal and distal influences on child smartphone and tablet use, would also be useful. Adopting more rigorous research practices in the future, will facilitate deeper insights into the potential developmental implications of smartphone and tablet use in early childhood.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract             Cyberbullying perpetration (CP) and victimization (CV) are prevalent issues in adolescent development. However, previous meta-analyses focused only on cross-sectional findings. The present study aims to meta-analytically summarize 56 longitudinal studies on CP, CV, and related factors in children and adolescents. Forty meta-analyses on CP and CV as both predictors and outcomes of person-related, Internet activity-related, and contextual factors were performed. Additional moderator analyses took into account study design, sample population, and quality of the studies. Results highlight reciprocal longitudinal effects among CP, CV, and both traditional bullying and victimization: CP causes externalizing problem behaviors over time, whereas CV constitutes a risk factor of internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety. Conversely, behavioral problems and increased Internet use predict involvement in CP, while depression, anxiety, and Internet use also predict CV over time. Further longitudinal research is needed to provide empirical evidence on understudied concepts.}

  ABSTRACT = {The Covid-19 physical distancing measures had a detrimental effect on adolescents' mental health. Adolescents worldwide alleviated the negative experiences of social distancing by spending more time on digital devices. Through a systematic literature search in eight academic databases (including Eric, Proquest Sociology, Communication \&amp; Mass Media Complete, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Pubmed, and Web of Science), the present systematic review and meta-analysis first summarized the existing evidence from 30 studies, published up to September 2021, on the link between mental health and digital media use in adolescents during Covid-19. Digital media use measures included social media, screen time, and digital media addiction. Mental health measures were grouped into conceptually similar dimensions, such as well-being, ill-being, social well-being, lifestyle habits, and Covid-19-related stress. Results showed that, although most studies reported a positive association between ill-being and social media use (               r               = 0.171,               p               = 0.011) and ill-being and media addiction (               r               = 0.434,               p               = 0.024), not all types of digital media use had adverse consequences on adolescents' mental health. In particular, one-to-one communication, self-disclosure in the context of mutual online friendship, as well as positive and funny online experiences mitigated feelings of loneliness and stress. Hence, these positive aspects of online activities should be promoted. At the same time, awareness of the detrimental effects of addictive digital media use should be raised: That would include making adolescents more aware of adverse mechanisms such as social comparison, fear of missing out, and exposure to negative contents, which were more likely to happen during social isolation and confinement due to the pandemic.}

This meta-analysis examines the effects of children's exposure to international co-productions of Sesame Street, synthesizing the results of 24 studies, conducted with over 10,000 children in 15 countries. The results indicated significant positive effects of exposure to the program, aggregated across learning outcomes, and within each of the three outcome categories: cognitive outcomes, including literacy and numeracy; learning about the world, including health and safety knowledge; social reasoning and attitudes toward out-groups. The effects were significant across different methods, and they were observed in both low- and middleincome countries and also in high-income countries. The results are contextualized by considering the effects and reach of the program, relative to other early childhood interventions.}

  ABSTRACT = {RATIONALE: High body mass and obesity are frequently linked to the use of sedentary media, like television (TV) or non-active video games. Empirical evidence regarding video gaming, however, has been mixed, and theoretical considerations explaining a relationship between general screen time and body mass may not generalize to non-active video gaming. OBJECTIVE: The current meta-analysis had two main goals. First, we wanted to provide an estimate of the average effect size of the relationship between sedentary video gaming and body mass. In doing so we acknowledged several context variables to gauge the stability of the average effect. Second, to provide additional evidence on processes, we tested the displacement effect of physical activity by video gaming time with the help of a meta-analytic structural equation model (MASEM). METHOD: Published and unpublished studies were identified through keyword searches in different databases and references in relevant reports were inspected for further studies. We present a random-effects, three-level meta-analysis based on 20 studies (total N\,=\,38,097) with 32 effect sizes. RESULTS: The analyses revealed a small positive relationship between non-active video game use and body mass, {$\rho$}\textasciicircum =.09, 95\% CI [0.03, 0.14], indicating that they shared less than 1\% in variance. The studies showed significant heterogeneity, Q (31)\,=\,593.03, p\,{$<$}\,.001, I(2)\,=\,95.13. Moderator analyses revealed that the relationship was more pronounced for adults, {$\rho$}\textasciicircum =.22, 95\% CI [0.04, 0.40], as compared to adolescents, {$\rho$}\textasciicircum =.01, 95\% CI [-0.21, 0.23], or children, {$\rho$}\textasciicircum =.09, 95\% CI [-0.07, 0.25]. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling found little evidence for a displacement of physical activity through time spent on video gaming. CONCLUSION: These results do not corroborate the assumption of a strong link between video gaming and body mass as respective associations are small and primarily observed among adults.}

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Gamification refers to the use of game elements in nongame contexts. The use of gamification to change behaviors and promote physical activity (PA) is a promising avenue for tackling the global physical inactivity pandemic and the current prevalence of chronic diseases. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of gamified interventions with the existence of mixed results in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of gamified interventions and their health care potential by testing the generalizability and sustainability of their influence on PA and sedentary behavior. METHODS: A total of 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for randomized controlled trials published in English from 2010 to 2020. Eligibility criteria were based on the components of the participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes framework. Studies were included when they used gamified interventions in daily life with an active or inactive control group and when they assessed a PA or sedentary behavior outcome. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model approach. Sensitivity analyses, influence analyses, and publication bias analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our results. RESULTS: The main meta-analysis performed on 16 studies and 2407 participants revealed a small to medium summary effect of gamified interventions on PA behavior (Hedges g=0.42, 95\% CI 0.14-0.69). No statistical difference among different subgroups (adults vs adolescents and healthy participants vs adults with chronic diseases) and no interaction effects with moderators such as age, gender, or BMI were found, suggesting good generalizability of gamified interventions to different user populations. The effect was statistically significant when gamified interventions were compared with inactive control groups, such as waiting lists (Hedges g=0.58, 95\% CI 0.08-1.07), and active control groups that included a nongamified PA intervention (Hedges g=0.23, 95\% CI 0.05-0.41). This suggests that gamified interventions are not only efficient in changing behavior but also more effective compared with other behavioral interventions. The long-term effect (measured with follow-up averaging 14 weeks after the end of the intervention) was weaker, with a very small to small effect (Hedges g=0.15, 95\% CI 0.07-0.23). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms that gamified interventions are promising for promoting PA in various populations. Additional analyses revealed that this effect persists after the follow-up period, suggesting that it is not just a novelty effect caused by the playful nature of gamification, and that gamified products appear effective compared with equivalent nongamified PA interventions. Future rigorous trials are required to confirm these findings.}

  ABSTRACT = {The results of a meta-analysis of 20 research articles containing 89 effect sizes related to the use of digital tools and learning environments to enhance literacy acquisition for middle school students demonstrate that technology can have a positive effect on reading comprehension (weighted effect size of 0.489). Very little research has focused on the effect of technology on other important aspects of reading, such as metacognitive, affective, and dispositional outcomes. The evidence permits the conclusion that there is reason to be optimistic about using technology in middle-school literacy programs, but there is even greater reason to encourage the research community to redouble its efforts to investigate and understand the impact of digital learning environments on students in this age range and to broaden the scope of the interventions and outcomes studied.}

  ABSTRACT = {In this article, we review research on the outcomes of diverse reading programs on the achievement of struggling readers in elementary schools. Sixty-five studies of 51 different programs met rigorous standards. Eighty-three percent were randomized experiments and 17\% quasi-experiments. Outcomes were positive for one-to-one tutoring and were positive but not as large for one-to-small group tutoring. There were no differences in outcomes between teachers and teaching assistants as tutors. Whole-class approaches (mostly cooperative learning) and whole-class/whole-school approaches incorporating tutoring for struggling readers obtained outcomes for struggling readers as large as those found for all forms of tutoring, on average, and benefited many more students. Technology-supported adaptive instruction did not have statistically significant positive outcomes for struggling readers, however. In agreement with findings of previous reviews, in this synthesis, we found that substantial impacts can be obtained for struggling readers, with interventions aligned within a Response to Intervention network.}

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Digital media has been used mostly to deliver clinical treatments and therapies; however limited evidence evaluates digital interventions for health promotion. The objective of this review is to identify digital interventions for universal health promotion in school-aged children and adolescents globally. METHODS: Eligible articles were searched in PubMed, Embase, Medline, Ovid SP, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, WHO regional databases, Google Scholar, and reference lists from 2000 to March 2021. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies evaluating interventions that promote health in school-aged children and adolescents (5-19.9 years) were included. Methods were conducted in duplicate. Where possible, data were pooled with a random-effects model. RESULTS: Seventy-four studies were included (46\,998 participants), of which 37 were meta-analyzed (19\,312 participants). Interventions increased fruit and vegetable consumption (servings per day) (mean difference [MD] 0.63, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 1.04; studies = 6; P = .003; high quality of evidence), and probably reduced sedentary behavior (MD -19.62, 95\% CI -36.60 to -2.65; studies = 6; P = .02; moderate quality of evidence), and body fat percentage (MD -0.35\%, 95\% CI -0.63 to -0.06; studies = 5; P = .02; low quality of evidence). The majority of studies were conducted in high-income countries and significant heterogeneity in design and methodology limit generalizability of results. CONCLUSIONS: There is great potential in digital platforms for universal health promotion; however, more robust methods and study designs are necessitated. Continued research should assess factors that limit research and program implementation in low- to middle-income countries. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.}

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract                            Introduction               In light of growing concerns about an increasingly digital adolescence, the academic field investigating how digital technologies affect adolescents' psychological well-being is growing rapidly. In the last years, much research has amassed, and this has been summarised in over 80 systematic reviews and meta-analyses.                                         Materials and Methods               Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and key studies are reviewed to provide insights into the state of current research linking digital technology and social media use to well-being; possible future directions and improvements are discussed.                                         Results               When examining the reviews, it becomes evident that the research field is dominated by cross-sectional work that is generally of a low quality standard. While research has highlighted the importance of differentiating between different types of digital technology use many studies do not consider such necessary nuances. These limitations aside, the association between digital technology use, or social media use in particular, and psychological well-being is\textemdash on average\textemdash negative but very small. Furthermore, the direction of the link between digital technology use and well-being is still unclear: effects have been found to exist in both directions and there has been little work done to rule out potential confounders.                                         Conclusions               Reviewing the last decade of reviews in the area, it is evident that the research field needs to refocus on improving transparency, interpreting effect sizes and changing measurement. It also needs to show a greater appreciation for the individual differences that will inherently shape each adolescent's reaction to digital technologies.}

  ABSTRACT = {This research was carried out to determine whether the comprehension level differs according to the reading environment by examining the studies comparing the comprehension level according to reading from the screen and from the paper by using meta-analysis method. Meta-analysis method was used in this research. The data of the study were obtained from 12 studies (29 comparisons). All of these studies are studies in which Turkish texts are used in reading. The analysis of the obtained data was carried out using the Comprehensive MetaAnalysis software. In the interpretation of the studies, random effects model was taken as basis. As a result of the analyses performed, a significant and medium effect size (g=-0.423, p=0.003) was found in favor of reading from the paper. Therefore, this result shows that comprehension achievement is higher in reading from the paper than reading from the screen. In addition, it was determined that the effect sizes did not differ significantly according to the publication year, grade level, text type and digital tool. It is recommended to perform studies on improving the screen interface and screen reading skills.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did and what they found. Over the last decade, there have been many advances in systematic review methodology and terminology, which have necessitated an update to the guideline.Objectives: To develop the PRISMA 2020 statement for reporting systematic reviews.Methods: We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement. We sought feedback on the suggested modifications through an online survey of 110 systematic review methodologists and journal editors. The results of the review and survey were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, drafts of the PRISMA 2020 checklist, abstract checklist, explanation and elaboration and flow diagram were generated and refined iteratively based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.Results: In this statement paper, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews. The checklist includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement.Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent, complete and accurate reporting of systematic reviews. Improved reporting should benefit users of reviews, including guideline developers, policy makers, health care providers, patients and other stakeholders. In order to achieve this, we encourage authors, editors and peer-reviewers to adopt the guideline.}

  ABSTRACT = {A meta-analysis is performed on studies pertaining to the effect of television violence on aggressive behavior. Partitioning by research design, viewer attributes, treatment and exposure variables, and type of antisocial behavior, allows one to interpret computed effect sizes for each of the variables in the partitions. We find a positive and significant correlation between television violence and aggressive behavior, albeit to varying degrees depending on the particular research question. According to research design, we find Z               Fisher               values ranging from .19 for survey to .40 for laboratory experiments. Erotica emerges as a strong factor even when it is not accompanied by portrayal of violence. Additionally, the effect of television violence on the antisocial behavior of boys and girls is found to be marginally equal in surveys. A host of tests are performed to solidify these, and further results. Substantive interpretation is provided as well.}

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract             There is evidence that diet and nutrition are modifiable risk factors for several cancers, but associations may be flawed due to inherent biases. Nutritional epidemiology studies have largely relied on a single assessment of diet using food frequency questionnaires. We conduct an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies to evaluate the strength and validity of the evidence for the association between food/nutrient intake and risk of developing or dying from 11 primary cancers. It is estimated that only few single food/nutrient and cancer associations are supported by strong or highly suggestive meta-analytic evidence, and future similar research is unlikely to change this evidence. Alcohol consumption is positively associated with risk of postmenopausal breast, colorectal, esophageal, head \& neck and liver cancer. Consumption of dairy products, milk, calcium and wholegrains are inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk. Coffee consumption is inversely associated with risk of liver cancer and skin basal cell carcinoma.}

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Internet or mobile device use as a form of information and communication technology (ICT) can be more effective in weight loss and weight maintenance than traditional obesity interventions. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to assess the effectiveness of child-centered ICT interventions on obesity-related outcomes. METHODS: Articles were retrieved from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and PubMed web-based databases. We selected randomized controlled trials in which the participants were aged {$<$}18 years. The primary outcomes were BMI, body weight, BMI z-score, waist circumference, and percentage body fat. RESULTS: In total, 10 of the initial 14,867 studies identified in the databases were selected according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 640 participants were included in the intervention group and 619 in the comparator group. Meta-analyses were conducted considering various subgroups (intervention type, comparator type, target participants, mean age, sex, BMI status, and follow-up period). Overall, ICT interventions demonstrated no significant effect on BMI, body weight, BMI z-score, waist circumference, and percentage body fat. Subgroup analyses revealed that the effect of the intervention was statistically significant for the following: web intervention (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-1.26 kg/m(2), 95\% CI -2.24 to -0.28), lifestyle modification comparator (WMD=-1.75, 95\% CI -2.76 to -0.74), intervention involving both boys and girls (WMD=-1.30, 95\% CI -2.14 to -0.46), and intervention involving obesity only (WMD=-1.92, 95\% CI -3.75 to -0.09). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results for children with obesity who used the web intervention program confirmed significant effects on BMI reduction compared with lifestyle modification. Evidence from the meta-analysis identified internet technology as a useful tool for weight loss in children with obesity.}

  ABSTRACT = {There is widespread public and academic interest in understanding the uses and effects of digital media. Scholars primarily use self-report measures of the quantity or duration of media use as proxies for more objective measures, but the validity of these self-reports remains unclear. Advancements in data collection techniques have produced a collection of studies indexing both self-reported and log-based measures. To assess the alignment between these measures, we conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis of this research. Based on 106 effect sizes, we found that self-reported media use correlates only moderately with logged measurements, that self-reports were rarely an accurate reflection of logged media use and that measures of problematic media use show an even weaker association with usage logs. These findings raise concerns about the validity of findings relying solely on self-reported measures of media use.},

  ABSTRACT = {Despite a general perception that violent or scary television creates anxiety in children, the research literature is small and disparate. A meta-analysis quantifies the impact of scary television and film on children's internalizing emotions (fear, anxiety, sadness, and sleep problems). Scary television has a relatively small impact on children's internalizing emotions (r = .18) overall, and this association was not significantly moderated by whether the televised material was factual (e.g., news) or fictional or contained violence. Children under 10 were more susceptible to scary TV. The overall result contrasts with the dramatic effects found for individual children within studies, suggesting that research is needed to unpick the factors that moderate the effect that scary television has on children.}

In particular, heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), and EE were assessed and three moderators for the effects of AVGs\textemdash types of AVG, player age, and player weight status\textemdash were analyzed. The results show that playing AVGs significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE from resting. The effect sizes of playing AVGs on HR, VO2, and EE were similar to traditional physical activities. AVG type and player age were significant moderators for the effects of AVGs. The finding suggests that AVGs are effective technologies that may facilitate light- to moderate-intensity physical activity promotion.}

  ABSTRACT = {To clarify and quantify the influence of video game violence (VGV) on aggressive behavior, we conducted a metaanalysis of all prospective studies to date that assessed the relation between exposure to VGV and subsequent overt physical aggression. The search strategy identified 24 studies with over 17,000 participants and time lags ranging from 3 months to 4 years. The samples comprised various nationalities and ethnicities with mean ages from 9 to 19 years. For each study we obtained the standardized regression coefficient for the prospective effect of VGV on subsequent aggression, controlling for baseline aggression. VGV was related to aggression using both fixed [{$\beta$} = 0.113, 95\% CI = (0.098, 0.128)] and random effects models [{$\beta$} = 0.106 (0.078, 0.134)]. When all available covariates were included, the size of the effect remained significant for both models [{$\beta$} = 0.080 (0.065, 0.094) and {$\beta$} = 0.078 (0.053, 0.102), respectively]. No evidence of publication bias was found. Ethnicity was a statistically significant moderator for the fixed-effects models (               P               {$\leq$} 0.011) but not for the random-effects models. Stratified analyses indicated the effect was largest among Whites, intermediate among Asians, and nonsignificant among Hispanics. Discussion focuses on the implications of such findings for current debates regarding the effects of violent video games on physical aggression.}

Our meta-analysis was based on 22 studies and included 13,460 participants. Results and discussion Results indicated that social anxiety (a) is correlated positively with feelings of comfort online, (b) is not correlated with total time spent online, email use and IM, but is correlated positively with time spent on gamming, and (c) is correlated positively with PIU. The study also found developmental level to be a moderator of the correlations between social anxiety and internet use variables. Research and clinical implications are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Although the time adolescents spend with digital technologies has sparked widespread concerns that their use might be negatively associated with mental well-being, these potential deleterious influences have not been rigorously studied. Using a preregistered plan for analyzing data collected from a representative sample of English adolescents ( n = 120,115), we obtained evidence that the links between digital-screen time and mental well-being are described by quadratic functions. Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i.e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings inform recommendations for limiting adolescents' technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous investigations into the relations between digital technology and children's and adolescents' health.}

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Difficulties in emotion regulation are common in adolescence and are associated with poor social and mental health outcomes. However, psychological therapies that promote adaptive emotion regulation may be inaccessible and unattractive to youth. Digital interventions may help address this need. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize evidence on the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of emotion regulation digital interventions in children and early adolescents aged 8 to 14 years. METHODS: Systematic searches of Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Centre, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore up to July 2020 identified 39 studies, of which 11 (28\%) were included in the meta-analyses (n=2476 participants). A bespoke tool was used to assess risk of bias. RESULTS: The studies evaluated digital games (27/39, 69\%), biofeedback (4/39, 10\%), virtual or augmented reality (4/39, 10\%), and program or multimedia (4/39, 10\%) digital interventions in samples classified as diagnosed, at risk, healthy, and universal. The most consistent evidence came from digital games, which reduced negative emotional experience with a small significant effect, largely in youth at risk of anxiety (Hedges g=-0.19, 95\% CI -0.34 to -0.04). In general, digital interventions tended to improve emotion regulation, but this effect was not significant (Hedges g=0.19, 95\% CI -0.16 to 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Most feasibility issues were identified in diagnosed youth, and acceptability was generally high across intervention types and samples. Although there is cause to be optimistic about digital interventions supporting the difficulties that youth experience in emotion regulation, the predominance of early-stage development studies highlights the need for more work in this area.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background. An adequate intake of fruits and vegetables (FVI) has shown benefits for reduced risk of manifesting chronic diseases. Thus, development of effective interventions to promote FVI is paramount. Aim. To assess the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for FVI targeted to healthy population, in comparison with control groups, and identify the moderators contributing to their effectiveness. Method. A database search was conducted in April 2016 and July 2018 using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC, Google Scholar, SciELO, and RISS, yielding 19 eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias Tool. Random-effects model was used to calculate effect sizes (ES) by weighted standardized mean differences. Results. This meta-analysis includes 19 studies and 6,894 participants. The most common eHealth tool used was Internet-based interventions ( n = 10). Most of studies were conducted in adults ( n = 11), followed by children ( n = 4), and adolescents ( n = 4). The minimum number of behavior change techniques (BCTs) used was one, and the maximum seven. The overall ES was small (0.26, p {$<$} .001), favoring eHealth interventions. The between-studies heterogeneity was large ( I               2               = 62.77\%, p {$<$} .001). Subgroup analyses showed that the components with larger ES were tailored interventions (0.27, p {$<$} .001), computer-based interventions (0.44, p {$<$} .001), and use of {$\geq$}7 BCTs (0.42, p {$<$} .001). Discussion. All studies showed a positive ES favoring interventions. Large heterogeneity could be explained in part by the number of BCTs and type of eHealth tool used. Nonetheless, more concrete evidence regarding other intervention components effectiveness was limited by small sample size. Conclusion. The use of eHealth tools for the improvement of FVI showed to be more effective compared with nonintervention and interventions not using these technologies. Nonetheless, more research is needed to determine the specific combination of intervention components that could translate into larger effectiveness.}

  ABSTRACT = {Marketing of foods and beverages high in fat, sugar and salt are suggested to contribute to poor dietary behaviours in children and diet-related diseases later in life. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials aimed to assess the effects of unhealthy food and beverage marketing on dietary intake (grams or kilocalories) and dietary preference (preference score or percentage of participants who selected specific foods/beverages) among children 2 to 18 years of age. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to January 2015 for terms related to advertising, unhealthy foods or beverages among children. Randomized trials that assessed the effects of unhealthy food and beverage marketing compared with non-dietary advertisement or no advertisement in children were considered eligible. Two authors independently extracted information on study characteristics and outcomes of interest and assessed risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence using grade methodology. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for dietary intake and preference using a random-effects model. We identified 29 eligible studies, of which 17 studies were included for meta-analysis of dietary preference and nine for meta-analysis of dietary intake. Almost half of the studies were at high risk of bias. Our meta-analysis showed that in children exposed to unhealthy dietary marketing, dietary intake significantly increased (mean difference [MD] = 30.4 kcal, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.9 to 57.9, and MD = 4.8 g, 95\%CI 0.8 to 8.8) during or shortly after exposure to advertisements. Similarly, children exposed to the unhealthy dietary marketing had a higher risk of selecting the advertised foods or beverages (relative risk = 1.1, 95\%CI 1.0 to 1.2; P = 0.052). The evidence indicates that unhealthy food and beverage marketing increases dietary intake (moderate quality evidence) and preference (moderate to low quality evidence) for energy-dense, low-nutrition food and beverage. Unhealthy food and beverage marketing increased dietary intake and influenced dietary preference in children during or shortly after exposure to advertisements. \textcopyright{} 2016 World Obesity},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract                            Background               Excessive engagement with digital screens is harmful to children's health. However, new evidence suggests that exposure at moderate levels may not be harmful and may even provide benefit. Therefore, our objective was to determine if there are curvilinear relationships between different types of screen time and a diverse set of outcomes, including health and education.                                         Methods                                We address our objective using a repeated measures design. Children (                 N                 ~=\,4013), initially aged 10\textendash 11 were assessed every 2 years between 2010 and 2014. Children's screen time behavior was measured using time-use diaries, and categorized into five types: social, passive, interactive, educational, or other. We used measures of children's physical health, health-related quality of life, socio-emotional outcomes, and school achievement. The analysis plan was pre-registered. Models were adjusted for gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, number of siblings, and housing factors.                                                        Results               There were linear associations between total screen time and all outcomes, such that more screen time was associated with worse outcomes. However, there was variability when examined by screen time type. Passive screen time (e.g., TV) was associated with worse outcomes, educational screen time (e.g., computer for homework) was associated with positive educational outcomes and had no negative relations with other outcomes. Interactive screen time (e.g., video games) had positive associations with educational outcomes but negative associations with other outcomes. In all instances, these significant associations were small or very small, with standardised effects {$<$}\,0.07. We found little evidence of curvilinear relationships.                                         Conclusions               The small effects of screen time on children's outcomes appear to be moderated by the type of screen time. Policy makers, educators, and parents should consider the type of screen time when considering the benefits and harms of use.},

  ABSTRACT = {Research on the use of software programs and tools such as pedagogical agents has peaked over the last decade. Pedagogical agents are on-screen characters that facilitate instruction. This meta-analysis examined the effect of using pedagogical agents on learning by reviewing 43 studies involving 3,088 participants. Analysis of the results indicated that pedagogical agents produced a small but significant effect on learning. The overall mean effect size was moderated by the contextual and methodological features of the studies. The findings revealed that the use of pedagogical agents were more beneficial for K-12 students than post-secondary students. Pedagogical agents that communicated with students using on-screen text facilitated learning more effectively than agents that communicated using narration. The findings of this study have implications for advancing theory and practice, as well as highlighting productive future directions for research.}

  ABSTRACT = {Aim To examine the efficacy and acceptability of online, interactive interventions for smoking cessation and to identify treatment effect moderators and mediators. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature (1990\textendash 2008) was conducted, finding 11 relevant randomized controlled trials. Data were extracted and risk ratios and risk differences estimated with a random effects model. Results There was no evidence of publication bias. Included trials were of variable methodological quality. Web-based, tailored, interactive smoking cessation interventions were effective compared with untailored booklet or e-mail interventions [rate ratio (RR) 1.8; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.4\textendash 2.3] increasing 6-month abstinence by 17\% (95\% CI 12\textendash 21\%). No overall effect of interactive compared with static web-based interventions was detected but there was significant heterogeneity, with one study obtaining a clear effect and another failing to find one. Few moderating or mediating factors were evaluated in studies and those that were had little effect. Pooled results suggest that only interventions aimed at smokers motivated to quit were effective (RR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.0\textendash 1.7). Fully automated interventions increased smoking cessation rates (RR 1.4, 95\% CI 1.0\textendash 2.0), but evidence was less clear-cut for non-automated interventions. Overall, the web-based interventions evaluated were considered to be acceptable and user satisfaction was generally high. Conclusion Interactive, web-based interventions for smoking cessation can be effective in aiding cessation. More research is needed to evaluate the relative efficacy of interactive web-based interventions compared with static websites.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Technology is ever evolving, with more and more diverse activities becoming possible on screen-based devices. However, participating in a heavy screen-based lifestyle may come at a cost. Our hypothesis was that problematic social media use increased the prevalence of mental health outcomes. Objective: This study seeks to systematically examine problematic social media use in youth and its association with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify studies in adolescents and young adults, using the databases Engineering Village, Psycinfo, Pubmed, and Web of Science. A total of 18 studies were identified, with a total of 9269 participants in our review and included in the meta-analysis. Results: Our metaregression shows moderate but statistically significant correlations between problematic social media use and depression (r=0.273, P{$<$}.001), anxiety (r=0.348, P{$<$}.001), and stress (r=0.313, P{$<$}.001). We did not find evidence of heterogeneity of these summary correlations by age, gender, or year of publication. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence of the association between problematic social media use and negative mental health among adolescents and young adults and supports future research to focus on the underlying mechanisms of problematic use of social media.

  ABSTRACT = {An increasing number of studies associate online media consumption with depressive symptoms in young people (10-24 years). However, the findings have been somewhat contradictory. This systematic review and meta analysis aimed to examine whether the contradictory findings are due to inconsistency in type and/or measurement of online media. A review of six databases identified 531 studies (476 cross-sectional, 52 longitudinal, 3 studies used both designs) on the relationship between online media use and depressive symptoms in young people. The results showed a small bi-directional association between online media use and depressive symptoms. However, the association was significantly greater for studies that measured online media use with media addiction scales than as amount of time spent using online media. The effect size did not differ as a function of media type (internet, smartphone, social media or online gaming). These findings suggest that depressive symptoms are more closely tied to the subjective experience of addiction to online media use rather than the actual or perceived time spent on it. Further, depressive symptoms may be linked to factors that are common to spending time online, such as a lack of physical activity and sleep, less time with friends and family, or being a perpetrator and/or victim of cyberbullying.}

Although CBT offers many advantages over traditional paper-and-pencil testing, assessment experts, researchers, practitioners, and users have expressed concern about the comparability of scores between the two test administration modes. To help provide an answer to this issue, a meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the administration mode effects of CBTs and paper-and-pencil tests on K\textemdash 12 student reading assessments. Findings indicate that the administration mode had no statistically significant effect on K\textemdash 12 student reading achievement scores. Four moderator variables\textemdash study design, sample size, computer delivery algorithm, and computer practice\textemdash made statistically significant contributions to predicting effect size. Three moderator variables\textemdash grade level, type of test, and computer delivery method\textemdash did not affect the differences in reading scores between test modes.}

  ABSTRACT = {This article reviews research on the achievement outcomes of three types of approaches to improving elementary mathematics: mathematics curricula, computer-assisted instruction (CAI), and instructional process programs. Study inclusion requirements included use of a randomized or matched control group, a study duration of at least 12 weeks, and achievement measures not inherent to the experimental treatment. Eighty-seven studies met these criteria, of which 36 used random assignment to treatments. There was limited evidence supporting differential effects of various mathematics textbooks. Effects of CAI were moderate. The strongest positive effects were found for instructional process approaches such as forms of cooperative learning, classroom management and motivation programs, and supplemental tutoring programs. The review concludes that programs designed to change daily teaching practices appear to have more promise than those that deal primarily with curriculum or technology alone.}

  ABSTRACT = {This article reviews research on the achievement outcomes of mathematics programs for middle and high schools. Study inclusion requirements include use of a randomized or matched control group, a study duration of at least 12 weeks, and equality at pretest. There were 100 qualifying studies, 26 of which used random assignment to treatments. Effect sizes were very small for mathematics curricula and for computer-assisted instruction. Positive effects were found for two cooperative learning programs. Outcomes were similar for disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students and for students of different ethnicities. Consistent with an earlier review of elementary programs, this article concludes that programs that affect daily teaching practices and student interactions have more promise than those emphasizing textbooks or technology alone.}

  ABSTRACT = {We conducted a comprehensive synthesis of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) research that aimed to facilitate the learning of mathematical word problem solving involving elementary and secondary school students with learning disabilities or difficulties in mathematics. We examined a total of 13 studies under the four instructional categories: direct instruction/guided practice, cognitive/metacognitive strategy instruction, schema-based instruction, and mathematical model-based problem solving. Findings from this review indicate that CAI showed overall positive effects on enhancing students' word problem-solving performance, with mathematical model-based problem solving being most effective and the direct instruction/guided practice least effective. It seems that CAI programs that promote mathematical model-based problem solving have demonstrated promising effects, not only on students' skill acquisition but also skill generalization as measured by commercially published standardized tests.

  ABSTRACT = {Objectives               To systematically examine the evidence of harms and benefits relating to time spent on screens for children and young people's (CYP) health and well-being, to inform policy.                                         Methods               Systematic review of reviews undertaken to answer the question `What is the evidence for health and well-being effects of screentime in children and adolescents (CYP)?' Electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews in February 2018. Eligible reviews reported associations between time on screens (screentime; any type) and any health/well-being outcome in CYP. Quality of reviews was assessed and strength of evidence across reviews evaluated.                                         Results               13 reviews were identified (1 high quality, 9 medium and 3 low quality). 6 addressed body composition; 3 diet/energy intake; 7 mental health; 4 cardiovascular risk; 4 for fitness; 3 for sleep; 1 pain; 1 asthma. We found moderately strong evidence for associations between screentime and greater obesity/adiposity and higher depressive symptoms; moderate evidence for an association between screentime and higher energy intake, less healthy diet quality and poorer quality of life. There was weak evidence for associations of screentime with behaviour problems, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, poorer self-esteem, poorer well-being and poorer psychosocial health, metabolic syndrome, poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, poorer cognitive development and lower educational attainments and poor sleep outcomes. There was no or insufficient evidence for an association of screentime with eating disorders or suicidal ideation, individual cardiovascular risk factors, asthma prevalence or pain. Evidence for threshold effects was weak. We found weak evidence that small amounts of daily screen use is not harmful and may have some benefits.                                         Conclusions               There is evidence that higher levels of screentime is associated with a variety of health harms for CYP, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Evidence to guide policy on safe CYP screentime exposure is limited.                                         PROSPERO registration number               CRD42018089483.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Fast ForWord is a suite of computer-based language intervention programs designed to improve children's reading and oral language skills. The programs are based on the hypothesis that oral language difficulties often arise from a rapid auditory temporal processing deficit that compromises the development of phonological representations. Methods: A systematic review was designed, undertaken and reported using items from the PRISMA statement. A literature search was conducted using the terms `Fast ForWord'`Fast For Word'`Fastforword' with no restriction on dates of publication. Following screening of (a) titles and abstracts and (b) full papers, using pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, six papers were identified as meeting the criteria for inclusion (randomised controlled trial (RCT) or matched group comparison studies with baseline equivalence published in refereed journals). Data extraction and analyses were carried out on reading and language outcome measures comparing the Fast ForWord intervention groups to both active and untreated control groups. Results: Meta-analyses indicated that there was no significant effect of Fast ForWord on any outcome measure in comparison to active or untreated control groups. Conclusions: There is no evidence from the analysis carried out that Fast ForWord is effective as a treatment for children's oral language or reading difficulties.},

  ABSTRACT = {Young children often learn less from video than face-to-face presentations. Meta-regression models were used to examine the average size of this difference (video deficit) and investigate moderators. An average deficit of about half of a standard deviation was reported across 122 independent effect sizes from 59 reports, involving children ages 0-6 years. Moderator analyses suggested (a) the deficit decreased with age, (b) object retrieval studies showed larger deficits than other domains, and (c) there was no difference between studies using live versus prerecorded video. Results are consistent with a multiple-mechanism explanation for the deficit. However, the analyses highlighted potential quality and publication bias issues that may have resulted in overestimation of the effect and should be addressed by future researchers.}

  ABSTRACT = {Currently, one of the main public health problems among children and adolescents is poor adherence to healthy habits, leading to increasingly high rates of obesity and the comorbidities that accompany obesity. Early interventions are necessary, and among them, the use of gamification can be an effective method. The objective was to analyse the effect of game-based interventions (gamification) for improving nutritional habits, knowledge, and changes in body composition. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, SciELO, and Scopus databases, following the PRISMA recommendations. There was no restriction by year of publication or language. Only randomized controlled trials were included. Twenty-three articles were found. After the intervention, the consumption of fruit and vegetables increased, as well as the knowledge on healthy food groups. The means difference showed a higher nutritional knowledge score in the intervention group 95\% CI 0.88 (0.05\textendash 1.75). No significant effect of gamification was found for body mass index z-score. Gamification could be an effective method to improve nutritional knowledge about healthier nutritional habits. Promoting the development of effective educational tools to support learning related to nutrition is necessary in order to avoid and prevent chronic diseases.}

  ABSTRACT = {Promoting the cultivation of computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in the K-12 curriculum, however, there is no unified conclusion on how to design programming activities to promote the acquisition of CT skills more effectively. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using programming to enhance K-12 students' CT skills and explore the influence of various programming instructional design factors on the acquisition of CT skills. This study presents a quantitative meta-analysis. A systematic search of randomized controlled studies on the influence of programming on CT skills. A total of 86 empirical studies with 114 effect sizes met the study selection criterion. The results showed that programming improved K-12 students' CT skills in general (Hedges' g = 0.601, 95\% CI [0.505, 0.697], p {$<$} 0.001). No publication bias was detected. Besides, we found that the interdisciplinary integration of programming, the duration of programming intervention within 1 week to 1 month, the class size of less than 50 students, and a reasonable selection of programming instruments and CT assessment types may be more conducive to promoting students' CT skills. Based on these findings, we suggest that programming instructional design should be planned reasonably to make the best use of technology towards developing students' CT skills. This will be of great significance to programming teaching and CT education in K-12. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: The cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in K-12 has become a key issue.One of the latest trends in the education field is computer programming in K-12 classrooms to cultivate students' CT skills.Programming teaching design may affect the influence of programming education on students' CT skills. However, there is a lack of overall quantitative synthesis of existing empirical research. What this paper adds: A meta-analysis of 86 studies was conducted to provide systematic evidence that programming education is effective to promote K-12 students' CT skills.Programming teaching design factors such as subjects, intervention duration, sample size, programming instruments and assessment types can affect CT skills in programming activities.Programming activity forms cannot affect CT skills in programming activities. Implications for practice and/or policy: The implementation of programming education in K-12 schooling can effectively cultivate students' CT skills.Programming teaching design should be planned reasonably to make the best use of technology towards developing students' CT skills.The interdisciplinary integration of programming, the duration of programming intervention within one week to one month, control of class size to less than 50 students, and a reasonable selection of programming instruments and assessment types may be more conducive to promoting students' CT skills.

  ABSTRACT = {IN THIS PAPER WE REPORT SOME initial findings from our investigations into the Australian Government's Longitudinal Study of Australian Children dataset. It is revealed that the majority of Australian children are exceeding the government's Screen Time recommendations and that most of their screen time is spent as TV viewing, as opposed to video game play or computer use. In light of this finding, we review the body of research surrounding children's engagement in Screen Time activities and the associated positive and negative effects. Based on existing evidence, we define two categories of Screen Time\textemdash Active Screen Time and Passive Screen Time. It is proposed that this distinction provides a more accurate classification of Screen Time and a more informative lens through which to consider the associated benefits and detrimental effects for young children.}

A small but significant additional benefit of technology was found for story comprehension (g+ = 0.17) and expressive vocabulary (g+ = 0.20), based on data from 2,147 children in 43 studies. When investigating the different characteristics of technology-enhanced stories, multimedia features like animated pictures, music, and sound effects were found beneficial. In contrast, interactive elements like hotspots, games, and dictionaries were found to be distracting. Especially for children disadvantaged because of less stimulating family environments, multimedia features were helpful and interactive features were detrimental. Findings are discussed from the perspective of cognitive processing theories.},

A study-level meta-analytic validation was also conducted for purposes of comparison. An extensive literature search and a systematic review process resulted in the inclusion of 25 meta-analyses with minimal overlap in primary literature, encompassing 1,055 primary studies. The random effects mean effect size of 0.35 was significantly different from zero. The distribution was heterogeneous under the fixed effects model. To validate the second-order meta-analysis, 574 individual independent effect sizes were extracted from 13 out of the 25 meta-analyses. The mean effect size was 0.33 under the random effects model, and the distribution was heterogeneous. Insights about the state of the field, implications for technology use, and prospects for future research are discussed.}

The meta-analysis method has been used in the study. 15 out of 171 reviews, whose effect size of the data may be calculated, and released between the years 2005 and 2015 have been included in the meta analytic effect size analysis. The reviews were intended to examine the efficiency of augmented reality applications in education and were selected after scanning the SCI and SSCI Indices. The names and the abstracts of the reviews were taken as bases in the classifying according to the target audience and subjects. It was determined as a conclusion in the study that the average effect size of the augmented reality applications in education was ES = 0.677. In other words, it was determined that the applications performed by using the augmented reality technology in education had a positive effects on students, and that this effect was at medium level that could not be underestimated according to Thalheimer and Cook Classification. At the end of the study, the development of the augmented reality applications used in education, the missing points in present studies, and the new study areas are mentioned.},

  ABSTRACT = {Studies using large samples consistently find that more frequent users of digital media are lower in psychological well-being than less frequent users; even data sets used as evidence for weak effects show that twice as many heavy users (vs. light users) are low in well-being. Differences in perspective may stem from the statistics used; I argue that comparing well-being across levels of digital-media use is more useful than the percentage of variance explained, as most studies on digital-media use do not measure other influences on well-being (e.g., genetics, trauma), and these other influences, unlike frequency of digital-media use, are rarely controllable. Nonusers are generally lower in well-being than light users of digital media, however, suggesting that limited use may be beneficial. Longitudinal and experimental studies suggest that at least some of the causation moves from digital-media use to lower well-being. Mechanisms may include the displacement of activities more beneficial to well-being (sleep, face-to-face social interaction), upward social comparison, and cyberbullying.}

  ABSTRACT = {The use of social networking sites (SNSs) has become a widespread part of modern-day life. A recent proliferation of research regarding SNS use pertains to its association with self-reported depressive symptoms. The current meta-analysis evaluates this literature by assessing the relationship between SNS use and self-reported depressive symptoms. Based on 55 independent samples (N\,=\,80, 533), an effect size of r\,=\,.165 was obtained, indicating a small, positive, significant association between self-reported symptoms of depression and SNS use. Furthermore, the type of SNS use was identified to be a significant moderator of this relationship. Limitations of this meta-analysis include the use of mainly cross-sectional studies \textendash{} limiting the potential for causal claims \textendash, as well as the subjective categorization of certain moderator subgroups. The results of this review highlight the need for advancing various streams of future research; particularly, in determining the direction of the causal relationship between these two constructs, as well as better-defined and theory-grounded definitions of the different types of SNS use.}

  ABSTRACT = {Evidence for adverse health effects of excessive sedentary behaviour in children is predominantly based on cross-sectional studies, measuring TV viewing as proxy for sedentary behaviour. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the evidence on the prospective relationship between childhood sedentary behaviour and biomedical health indicators, overall and stratified by type of sedentary behaviour (TV viewing, computer use/games, screen time and objective sedentary time). PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane were systematically searched till January 2015. Methodological quality of all included studies was scored, and a best evidence synthesis was applied. We included 109 studies of which 19 were of high quality. We found moderate-to-strong evidence for a relationship of overall sedentary time with some anthropometrics (overweight/obesity, weight-for-height), one cardiometabolic biomarker (HDL-cholesterol) and some fitness indicators (fitness, being unfit). For other health indicators, we found no convincing evidence because of inconsistent or non-significant findings. The evidence varied by type of sedentary behaviour. The meta-analysis indicated that each additional baseline hour of TV viewing ({$\beta$} = 0.01, 95\%CI = [-0.002; 0.02]) or computer use ({$\beta$} = 0.00, 95\%CI = [-0.004; 0.01]) per day was not significantly related with BMI at follow-up. We conclude that the evidence for a prospective relationship between childhood sedentary behaviour and biomedical health is in general unconvincing.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract             The objectives of this meta-analysis were to provide an overview of the evidence regarding the effects of interventions, implemented in the school- and general population setting, aiming to prevent excessive sedentary behaviour in children and adolescents on (1) the amount of sedentary behaviour and (2) BMI. Differences in effects on sedentary behaviour and BMI between single health behaviour interventions (sedentary behaviour only) and multiple health behaviour interventions were explored.             A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Thirty-four (R)CT studies evaluating 33 general population interventions, published between 1990 and April 2011, aiming to decrease sedentary behaviour in normal weight children or adolescents (0\textendash 18\,years) were included. Intervention duration ranged from 7\,days to 4\,years. Mean change in sedentary behaviour and BMI from baseline to post-intervention was calculated using a random effects model.             Results showed significant decreases for the amount of sedentary behaviour and BMI. For sedentary behaviour the post-intervention mean difference was -17.95\,min/day (95\%CI:-26.61;\textendash 9.28); the change-from-baseline mean difference was -20.44\,min/day (95\%CI:-30.69;\textendash 10.20). For BMI the post-intervention mean difference was -0.25\,kg/m{$^2$} (95\%CI:-0.40;\textendash 0.09); the change-from-baseline mean difference was -0.14\,kg/m{$^2$} (95\%CI:-0.23;\textendash 0.05). No differences were found between single and multiple health behaviour interventions.             Interventions in the school- and general population setting aiming to reduce only sedentary behaviour and interventions targeting multiple health behaviours can result in significant decreases in sedentary behaviour. Studies need to increase follow-up time to estimate the sustainability of the intervention effects found.}

  ABSTRACT = {While watching or playing with media, children are often confronted with food appearances. These food portrayals might be a potential factor that affects a child's dietary behaviors. We aimed to comprehensively expound the effects of these types of food appearances on dietary outcomes of children. Our objectives were to synthetize the evidence of the experiments that study the effects of foods embedded in children's entertainment media throughout a systematic review, to conduct two meta-analyses (food choice and intake) in order to quantify the effects, and to examine to what extent the effects of foods embedded in entertainment media varies across different moderating variables. We conducted a systematic search of five databases for studies published up to July 2018 regarding terms related to children and foods embedded in entertainment media. We identified 26 eligible articles, of which 13 (20 effect sizes) and 7 (13 effect sizes) were considered for a meta-analysis on food choice and intake, respectively. Most of the studies were assessed as having a middle risk of bias. Overall, food being embedded in entertainment media is a strategy that affects the eating behaviors of children. As most of the embedded foods in the included studies had low nutritional values, urgent measures are needed to address the problem of childhood obesity.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background: Smartphone overuse has been cited as a potentially modifiable risk factor that can result in visual impairment. However, reported associations between smartphone overuse and visual impairment have been inconsistent.; Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to determine the association between smartphone overuse and visual impairment, including myopia, blurred vision, and poor vision, in children and young adults.; Methods: We conducted a systematic search in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and ScienceDirect databases since the beginning of the databases up to June 2020. Fourteen eligible studies (10 cross-sectional studies and 4 controlled trials) were identified, which included a total of 27,110 subjects with a mean age ranging from 9.5 to 26.0 years. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis of the 10 cross-sectional studies (26,962 subjects) and a fixed-effects model for meta-analysis of the 4 controlled trials (148 subjects) to combine odds ratios (ORs) and effect sizes (ES). The I 2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity.; Results: A pooled OR of 1.05 (95\% CI 0.98-1.13, P=.16) was obtained from the cross-sectional studies, suggesting that smartphone overuse is not significantly associated with myopia, poor vision, or blurred vision; however, these visual impairments together were more apparent in children (OR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.99-1.14, P=.09) than in young adults (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.57-1.46,P=.71). For the 4 controlled trials, the smartphone overuse groups showed worse visual function scores compared with the reduced-use groups. The pooled ES was 0.76 (95\% CI 0.53-0.99), which was statistically significant (P{$<$}.001).; Conclusions: Longer smartphone use may increase the likelihood of ocular symptoms, including myopia, asthenopia, and ocular surface disease, especially in children. Thus, regulating use time and restricting the prolonged use of smartphones may prevent ocular and visual symptoms. Further research on the patterns of use, with longer follow up on the longitudinal associations, will help to inform detailed guidelines and recommendations for smartphone use in children and young adults.

  ABSTRACT = {Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) for students with disabilities can be categorized into the following categories: visual, auditory, mobile, and cognitive skills-based CAI. Cognitive-skills based CAI differs from other types of CAI largely in terms of an emphasis on instructional design features. We conducted both systematic review of literatures and meta-analysis of studies using cognitive skills-based CAI to determine the effectiveness of this technology on the learning outcomes of students with disabilities. This study also scrutinized critical instructional design features of CAI used in the synthesized studies. Results indicated (a) a moderate weighted average effect size of 0.35 for group-comparison design studies; (b) relatively large effect sizes, but inconsistent among different indices, in single-subject experimental design studies; and (c) insufficient information available on design features of the CAI used in the primary studies. Limitations, implications, and future research directions were discussed.}

  ABSTRACT = {To integrate empirical findings concerning the impact of leisure time television viewing on student achievement in grades K-12, 274 correlations were assembled or calculated from 23 educational and psychological review articles, doctoral dissertations, statewide assessments, national surveys, articles from refereed journals, technical reports, books, and unpublished papers. For each study, characteristics of the sample, type of outcome, quality of the study, method of collecting viewing data, mean hours of viewing, and strength and direction of observed relationships were coded. The overall correlation of hours of televiewing and achievement is negative but small (\textendash.05). Regardless of the sample size, year and location of the research, the effect remains consistent. The overall effect, however, is not constant across the range of viewing times. The effects are slightly positive for up to 10 hours of viewing a week, but beyond 10 hours the effects are negative and increasingly more deleterious until viewing time reaches 35 to 40 hours, beyond which additional viewing has little effect. Females and high IQ children are more adversely affected than other groups.}

Methods: A systematic search from Scopus, PubMed and Embase electronic databases. Studies that evaluated the association between screen time and obesity up to June 2021. Results: Results revealed that those at the highest screen time category had 0.7 kg/m2 higher BMI (WMD = 0.703; CI = 0.128, 1.278; P \&lt; 0.016; I2 = 95.8\%). Moreover, children and adolescents with obesity had a mean value of 0.313 h higher screen time compared with children and adolescents without obesity (WMD: 0.313; OR = 0.219, 0.407; P \&lt; 0.001; I2 = 96\%). The results of subgrouping showed that study quality, continent and sample size could reduce the heterogeneity values. No evidence of publication bias was reported according to visual asymmetry of funnel plots and the results of Begg's and Egger's tests. Conclusion: For the first time, the current systematic review and meta-analysis revealed a positive association between screen time and obesity among children and adolescents. Due to the cross-sectional design of the included studies, causal inference is impossible, therefore, further studies in separate analysis of both genders are suggested to better elucidate gender-specific results.

  ABSTRACT = {The existing literature shows mixed results of how the use of social networking sites (SNSs) is related to mental health. Some studies provided evidence that SNS users are more mentally healthy because of the exchanged social support, while others argued that users tend to engage in upward social comparison, which would result in mental illness. To shed light on this relationship, we conducted a meta-analytic review to examine a) the association between SNS use and mental illness and b) the factors that moderate the association. A total of 1,451 studies were retrieved from six databases (i.e., Communication \& Mass Media Complete, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline), among which 37 empirical studies (N = 84,955) were eligible for meta-analysis based on the inclusion criteria (i.e., empirical and quantitative studies with human subjects, including sufficient statistical information for effect size computation, concerned with SNS use and mental illness). Results showed that SNS use is associated with not only the likelihood of experiencing overall mental illness (r = .11) but also specific illness, including depression (r = .10), suicidal ideation (r = .22), schizophrenia/mania (r = .09), and ADHD/hyperactivity (r = .27). In addition, the intensity of SNS use, continuous measurement (vs. categorical), and participants' health condition were found as positive moderators, whereas adopting social support as the theoretical framework and the proportion of African American participants as negative moderators of the association between SNS use and mental illness. Implications of the current study were discussed.}

  ABSTRACT = {The present meta-analysis reviews English-language studies from 2005 to 2016 to investigate the relationship between social networking sites (SNSs) usage and mental health and to explore whether cultural background, measurement of usage, gender and age influence this relationship. A total of 63 studies and 144 effect sizes (positive indicators of mental health k = 62, negative indicators of mental health k = 82) were analyzed. We found that (1) SNSs usage was positively correlated with both positive and negative indicators of mental health, and no significant difference between these two mean correlations was found; (2) age did not moderate the relationship between SNSs usage and mental health; (3) SNSs usage was positively related to positive indicators for measures of social network size, while general use was positively related to negative indicators; (4) stronger correlations were found between SNSs usage and positive indicators of mental health in collectivist cultures than in individualistic cultures; (5) as percentage of female participants increased, a stronger relationship between social network sites and negative indicators of mental health was observed. This meta-analysis allows for integration of conclusions of past studies and establishes a clearer understanding of the relations between SNSs usage and mental health, including recognizing that complex factors (such as cultural background and gender) moderate these relations.}

  ABSTRACT = {Background Facebook depression is defined as feeling depressed upon too much exposure to Social networking sites (SNS). Researchers have argued that upward social comparisons made on SNS are the key to the Facebook depression phenomenon. To examine the relations between SNS usage and depression, we conducted 4 separate meta-analyses relating depression to: (1) time spent on SNS, (2) SNS checking frequency, (3) general and (4) upward social comparisons on SNS. We compared the four mean effect sizes in terms of magnitude. Methods Our literature search yielded 33 articles with a sample of 15,881 for time spent on SNS, 12 articles with a sample of 8041 for SNS checking frequency, and 5 articles with a sample of 1715 and 2298 for the general and the upward social comparison analyses, respectively. Results In both SNS-usage analyses, greater time spent on SNS and frequency of checking SNS were associated with higher levels of depression with a small effect size. Further, higher levels of depression were associated with greater general social comparisons on SNS with a small to medium effect, and greater upward social comparisons on SNS with a medium effect. Both social comparisons on SNS were more strongly related to depression than was time spent on SNS. Limitations Limitations include heterogeneity in effect sizes and a small number of samples for social comparison analyses. Conclusions Our results are consistent with the notion of `Facebook depression phenomenon' and with the theoretical importance of social comparisons as an explanation.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews that have examined associations between sedentary behaviour (SB) and mental health among children and adolescents are mainly based on cross-sectional investigations. There is a lack of evidence for a prospective relationship between SB and mental health in children and adolescents. This systematic review synthesized longitudinal studies that examined prospective associations between SB and mental health among children and adolescents. METHODS: We conducted computer searches for English language literature from electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo and Google scholar, and manually screened the references of existing relevant studies to select studies for the synthesis. We included observational longitudinal studies that assessed the association between SB and mental health among children and adolescents. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 58 longitudinal studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized in the review. We found that higher SB among children and adolescents was associated with increased depression, anxiety and other mental health problems later in life. A dose-response association between SB and mental health was observed, suggesting that children and adolescents who spend more time on SB may have a higher risk of developing poorer mental health later. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the present study suggest that intervention programs targeting reducing SB may benefit to the prevention of poor mental health among children and adolescents. Future intervention studies especially randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate a causal relationship between SB and mental health among children and adolescents.}

  ABSTRACT = {Social media use and fear of missing out are both common phenomena in our daily life. Numerous studies have discussed the relationship between these two variables, but the results were mixed. Theoretically, there are two main arguments about the relationship between social media use and fear of missing out. To be specific, the social cognitive theory of mass communication suggested that there was a significant positive correlation between the two variables, while the digital goldilocks hypothesis argued that there may be a U-shaped relationship instead of a significant linear correlation between the two. Empirically, the effect sizes of this relationship reported in the existing literature were far from consistent, with r values ranging from 0 to 0.75. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to explore the strength and moderators of the relationship between social media use and fear of missing out.Through literature retrieval, 65 studies consisting of 70 independent effect sizes that met the inclusion criteria were selected. In addition, a random-effects model was selected to conduct the meta-analysis in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.3 software, aiming at testing our hypotheses. The heterogeneity test illustrated that there was significant heterogeneity among 70 independent effect sizes, indicating that the random-effects model was appropriate for subsequent meta-analyses. Based on the funnel plot and Egger's test of regression to the intercept, no significant publication bias was found in the included studies.The main effect analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between social media use and fear of missing out (r = 0.38). The moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between social media use and fear of missing out was moderated by the indicator of social media use, as well as the type of social media. Specifically, compared with the frequency, the time as well as the intensity of social media use, social media use addiction had the strongest correlation with fear of missing out; compared with Snapchat and Facebook, Instagram had the strongest correlation with fear of missing out. Other moderators such as gender, age, measurement tools of fear of missing out as well as individualism index did not moderate the relation between these two constructs. The results supported the media effect model, which suggested that social media use, especially social media use addiction may be an important risk factor for individuals' fear of missing out. Longitudinal studies are needed in the future to explore the dynamic relationship between social media use and fear of missing out.}

  ABSTRACT = {Backgrounds: Many literature reviews summarized relationships between screen time and child health, but they only included a few studies conducted in Chinese children and adolescents. The potential influence of screen time may vary by social context. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate relationships between screen time and health issues among Chinese school-aged children and adolescents. Methods: Peer-reviewed articles written in Chinese and English were retrieved from CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to June 2020. The Downs \&amp; Black checklist was applied to assess study quality. Meta analyses used random effect models and mixed effects model to calculate pooled adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity, sensitivity, and publication bias were assessed using Q and I2 statistics, ``one-study removed'' analysis, the funnel plot, trim and fill analysis, and classical fail-safe N, respectively. Results: In total, we identified 252 articles reporting 268 studies with unique samples. These studies investigated relationships between screen time and health issues of adiposity, myopia, psycho-behavioral problems, poor academic performance, cardiometabolic disease risks, sleep disorder, poor physical fitness, musculoskeletal injury, sub-health, and miscellaneous issues of height and pubertal growth, injury, sick leave, and respiratory symptoms. Proportions of studies reporting positive relationships with screen time were lowest in adiposity (50.6\%) and higher in myopia (59.2\%) and psycho-behavioral problems (81.8\%). Other health issues were examined in 10 or less studies, all of which had more than half showing positive relationships. The pooled odds ratio from 19 studies comparing~health risks with the screen time cutoff of 2~hours~per day~was 1.40 (95\% CI: 1.31 to 1.50, I2 = 85.9\%). The pooled effect size was 1.29 (95\% CI: 1.20 to 1.39) after trimming 7 studies for publication bias adjustments. Conclusions: Findings exclusively generated from Chinese school-aged children and adolescents resonate those mainly from western countries. Evidence suggests that higher levels of screen time are related with greater risks of various health issues, although the relationships appear to be weak and intertwined with other confounding factors. Future studies need to investigate health-specific dose effects and mechanisms of screen time. \textcopyright{} 2022, The Author(s).}

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: To conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between mobile phone addiction (MPA) and sleep disorder (SD) by reviewing current evidence from observational studies. METHODS: The meta-analysis was conducted by searching Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of science using a retrieval strategy related to MPA and SD. Pooled Odds ratios and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated by R software using a random effects model. RESULTS: 29 studies including a total of 20041 participants were identified. We found that MPA was significantly associated with an increased risk of adolescents having SD (OR~=~2.25, 95\%CI= 1.72-2.94). Additionally, the findings also demonstrated that weak-to-moderate positive correlations were found between MPA and SD (summary r~=~0.30, 95\%CI= 0.25-0.34). The meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis suggested that the geographic location and the measurement of MPA might be the sources of heterogeneity, and the robustness of the findings was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. LIMITATIONS: The information collected was self-reported, and the recall bias was inevitable. CONCLUSIONS: This study updated the findings of the association between MPA and SD from the previous reviews and was also the first meta-analysis to assess the association between MPA and SD using Odds Radios and correlation coefficients concurrently. The result of this study re-emphasized that paying more attention to the public health concerns of MPA and SD is needed in the future, whether implementation more relevant researches or developing targeted policies.}

  ABSTRACT = {Electronic books (e-books) are a prevalent method for integrating technology in preschool and elementary classrooms; however, there is a lack of consensus concerning the extent to which e-books increase literacy skills in the domains of comprehension and decoding. This article assesses the efficacy of e-books with a comprehensive review method, including a systematic literature search, comparison of outcomes with effect sizes, and discussion of individual studies that met either (a) randomized-trial synthesis criteria, or (b) quasi-experimental/observational narrative synthesis criteria. Seven studies met the randomized-trial criteria and 20 studies met the quasi-experimental/observational narrative review criteria. Results from the randomized trials indicate that the effects of e-books on comprehension-related outcomes were small to medium in size. Only two randomized trials examined decoding-related outcomes, thereby preventing firm conclusions. The narrative review suggests some interactive e-book features support comprehension, whereas other incongruent features may hinder comprehension. Educational implications and future research directions are discussed.}
